Strowman would make his return to WWE earlier this year and has been part of Friday Night Smackdown since then. Strowman has also been embroiled in a feud with Imperium, and now it seems Strowman decided to give GUNTHER a huge warning recently.</p><p>As seen on this week’s episode of Friday Night Smackdown, Ricochet teamed up with Braun Strowman and squared off against Imperium’s Ludwig Kaiser & Giovanni Vinci in a Miracle on 34th Street Fight. In the end, Strowman and Ricochet won the match.</p><p>While speaking to Megan Morant on&nbsp;SmackDown Lowdown this week, Braun Strowman talked about his current feud with Imperium. Strowman called GUNTHER a dirtbag and made it clear that he is coming for the Intercontinental Championship.</p><p>“You say it’s unfinished because you’re absolutely right. Gunther cost me the World Cup tournament. Ricochet took advantage of it and I don’t blame him. Gunther, on the other hand, is an absolute dirtbag. Those two clowns that run around with him, they think they can stick their nose in anybody’s business whenever they want to. They found out tonight that it don’t always happen on my watch.</p><p>I’m not forgetting what happened. You have that Intercontinental Championship and I promise you if I ever get my hands on you, I would love to be the monster to take the title away from your hands and put it where it belongs – around my waist. I’m coming for you, be ready!”</p><p>Ricochet also suffered <a href=#>some nasty wounds during the match</a>. We will have to wait and see when Braun Strowman will challenge GUNTHER for the Intercontinental Championship, as fans are certainly invested in their current feud.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Do you love Braun Strowman now?
