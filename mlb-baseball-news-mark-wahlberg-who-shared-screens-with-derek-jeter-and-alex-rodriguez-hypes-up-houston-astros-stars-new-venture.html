Every celebrity has their own favorite team, and such is the case with two-time Oscar nominee star Mark Wahlberg. In one of his most famous movies,&nbsp;</span><span>The Other Guys</span><span>, Wahlberg has worked with one of the best shortstops of MLB, Captain Clutch <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Derek Jeter</a>. Aside from this, he is also good friends with Jeter’s frenemy <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Alex ‘A-Rod’ Rodriguez</a>. But Wahlberg, being friends with Jeter and A-Rod, is not a fan of the New York Yankees but the Boston Red Sox, the sworn enemy of the Yanks. It seems like the actor has friends in many MLB teams, despite being a fan of a different team.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Now, most recently, Wahlberg met up with another one of his friends from the baseball world for his friend’s new venture. That friend is none other than the two times world champion, Alex Bregman of the Houston Astros.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><span>Mark Wahlberg supports his friends!</span></h2><p><span>The iconic actor took to Instagram to congratulate his friend and athlete, Alex Bregman, for introducing a different type of salsa for his company, Breggy Bomb Foods.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Hollywood actor posted a video of himself, Bregman, and the CEO of Flecha Azul Tequila, Aron Marquez. The three of them sat together as Wahlberg introduced the new tequila-infused salsa to his 21 million+ followers. He captioned the video, Wahlberg wrote,&nbsp;</span><span>“Always good seeing my guy @abreg_1 Congrats on the new tequila-infused salsas @breggybomb you already know the tequila @flechaazultequila.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Shortstop Bregman collaborated with Marquez to create something special, and the two entrepreneurs already got a fan for their latest fusion.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><span>What is Wahlberg up to these days?</span></h2><p><span>A few months ago, the Father Stu actor made a huge decision to move his family up from Hollywood to Nevada. He had done so to have a chance to enjoy life. With the aim of giving his wife and four kids to have a chance at a better and happy life, the actor had put his Beverly Hills mansion on the market.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Watch this Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>5 movies for every baseball fanatic&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p><span>Also, with a net worth of over $400 million, the move to Nevada was not tough. But at the same time, it wasn’t easy either. And no matter the actor resides now, his love for baseball has remained the same.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Which MLB team are you a fan of?
