The sound clip comes from the song “Remember (Walking in the Sand),” specifically a transition segment just before the first chorus. This song was written by legendary musician George “Shadow” Morton and was first recorded by the girl group The Shangri-Las in 1964.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=796 data-injectable=true>This track did really well at the time, becoming a top-five hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and even reaching #14 on the UK singles chart. Many critics and radio hosts praised the band’s vocal range and unique delivery of the lyrics, something that makes the song stand out even to this day. In fact, their unusual delivery of the “Oh No” is why the tune has become such a viral hit.</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>The song has been covered and re-released several times over the years. Singer-songwriter Louise Goffin included a cover of the track on her debut album Kid Blue. Famously, Aerosmith recorded a rock cover of the song in 1979 as part of their Night in the Ruts album. This version featured new backing vocals performed by former Shangri-Las member Mary Weiss. Alas, this role was uncredited.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>In 2005, Capone sampled part of the track and raised the pitch as part of his song “Streets Favorite.” This song was released on his album Pain, Time, & Glory. More recently, rapper Kreepa has used the track as the basis for their own song fittingly titled “Oh No.”</p><h2 id=h-how-the-oh-no-song-has-been-used-on-tiktok data-injectable=false>How the “Oh No” song has been used on TikTok</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@breelynn14 href=#>@breelynn14</a><p>🤦🏼‍♀️ <a title=ohno href=#>#ohno</a> <a title=ohnono href=#>#ohnono</a></p><a title="♬ Oh No - Kreepa" href=#>♬ Oh No – Kreepa</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><a title=@maakenziee href=#>@maakenziee</a><p>😂 <a title=ohno href=#>#ohno</a> <a title=funnybaby href=#>#funnybaby</a> <a title=babydance href=#>#babydance</a> <a title=ohnonononoo href=#>#ohnonononoo</a> <a title=cute href=#>#cute</a> <a title=cutebaby href=#>#cutebaby</a> <a title=toddlersoftiktok href=#>#toddlersoftiktok</a></p><a title="♬ Oh No - Kreepa" href=#>♬ Oh No – Kreepa</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@jensin.camille href=#>@jensin.camille</a><p>Do not try this ar home 🤣 <a title=fail href=#>#fail</a> <a title=epicfail href=#>#epicfail</a> <a title=embarrassing href=#>#embarrassing</a> <a title=pain href=#>#pain</a></p><a title="♬ Oh no, oh no, oh no, no no - Hip Hop" href=#>♬ Oh no, oh no, oh no, no no – Hip Hop</a></figure><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>This song has quickly gone viral and has been listened to millions of times across several platforms. <strong>TikTok</strong> users use both the original version, the Capone sample, and the Kreepa single interchangeably, so it isn’t uncommon to see people mislabeling or misattributing the track on videos.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>The popularity of “Remember (Walking in the Sand)” shows how the internet can cause the most unexpected content to go viral.
