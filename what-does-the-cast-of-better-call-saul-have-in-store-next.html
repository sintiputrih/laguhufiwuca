Many actors got to reprise their roles from Breaking Bad, but in a new light that let them explore different sides and earlier years of their characters, but there were also plenty of exciting new heroes and villains that graced the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With such an acclaimed show filled with talented performers, what's next for the actors of Better Call Saul? Here's what the cast has lined up after the show's conclusion.</p><h2 id=bob-odenkirk><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bob Odenkirk</span></h2><p>The man behind Jimmy McGill (Saul Goodman), Bob Odenkirk, has already begun a few exciting projects alongside the final seasons, including an action franchise that rivals John Wick. In 2021, we saw the release of the first in what will at least be a two film franchise with the action thriller Nobody where Odenkirk plays a seemingly normal family man who returns to his former life filled with a thirst for action and revenge. In December 2022, it was announced there would a sequel and filming would begin in 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Odenkirk also has a film called Life Upside-Down, which will premiere January 27th, telling the story of three couples in lockdown. But Odenkirk won't be straying too far from his television career, or the network that helped him find massive success - he will be starring as the lead in an upcoming show on AMC titled Lucky Hank (based on the novel Straight Man by Richard Russo).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>9 Brilliant Performances Of Bob Odenkirk, Apart From Better Call Saul</a></span></p><h2 id=rhea-seehorn><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Rhea Seehorn</span></h2><p>You can't talk about Better Call Saul and Saul Goodman without the strong and determined Kim Wexler by his side - played brilliantly by Rhea Sheehorn. Sheehorn has a few projects in the works, including a festival darling with the film Linoleum where she stars alongside comedian Jim Gaffigan - which will see a bigger release in 2023 after a string of festivals in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She will also reportedly be starring in Vince Gilligan's next project after Better Call Saul, which will stream on Apple TV+ after being picked up for two seasons, but much is still unknown about the series.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Really Happened To Kim Wexler On Better Call Saul, According to Rhea Sheehorn</a></span></p><h2 id=giancarlo-esposito><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Giancarlo Esposito</span></h2><p>An actor with one of the longest resumes in the industry, Giancarlo Esposito continues to have a plethora of work on both television, cinema, and even video games! And that also means the man behind the villainous <a href=#>Gus Fring</a> will have plenty of projects released in 2023 and in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In film, he will be starring in an impressive star-studded cast with The Electric State (planned for 2024), The Long Home (based off of the novel of the same name), and Francis Ford Coppola's next epic feature, Megalopolis.</p><p>For television, Esposito is set to star in a crime drama called Parish, based on a BBC One series called The Driver - it will air on AMC sometime in 2023. One of his latest television series also debuted in January 2023, titled Kaleidoscope - a heist drama on Netflix.</p><h2 id=jonathan-banks><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jonathan Banks</span></h2><p>The fixer and hit man with a sweet connection to his granddaughter in both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, Mike Ehrmantraut was expertly played by actor Jonathan Banks. Banks had a pretty <a href=#>expansive career</a> before the Breaking Bad universe with minor roles, but we'd love to see him truly shine as a leading man in upcoming work and may just get our prayers answered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Banks will be starring in an upcoming Apple TV show called Constellation that will explore space travel and is in talks to star in the film The Damaged, the story of two hit men in Vegas.</p><h2 id=patrick-fabian><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Patrick Fabian</span></h2><p>While he often proved to be a foil to Saul, we were all shocked to see Patrick Fabian's Howard Hamlin meet such <a href=#>a heartbreaking demise in the show's final season</a>. Thankfully we'll be getting more of Fabian on our screens with a slew of films in the works.</p><p>Fabian will be starring in a short called The Hereafter, the father of a high school senior's love interest who gets amnesia in the film The Other Zoey, and as a voice actor for Harvey Dent in Batman: The Doom That Came to Gotham. But if you want to see more of Fabian right now, his winter horror film Snow Falls was recently released for streaming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-mando><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Michael Mando</span></h2><p>Michael Mando's Nacho Varga quickly became a fan-favorite character on Better Call Saul. Besides Better Call Saul, Mando has starred in the show Orphan Black, Spider-Man Homecoming, and as antagonist Vaas Montenegro in the Far Cry video game franchise.</p><p>After the series ended, only one project has been discussed for the actor, a TV series set to premiere in 2023 called Sinking Spring. We hope after Mando's stellar performances he will get a chance to prove himself further in more series and films in the future.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Michael Mando's Life And Career Are Like Outside Better Call Saul</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tony-dalton><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Tony Dalton</span></h2><p>Tony Dalton delivered one of the best and most chilling villains in Better Call Saul - a figure only alluded to in Breaking Bad as a throw away line by Saul Goodman.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Lalo Salamanca</a> wrecked havoc on the series and some of the most beloved characters.</p><p>Alongside the show's ending, Dalton appeared as a swordsman and socialite in the Marvel miniseries Hawkeye. However, Dalton's career has primarily been in Mexican television and film - which will continue with an upcoming romantic comedy called Dime Lo que Quieres (Tell Me What You Really Want). Little else is in the works, but we wouldn't be surprised if Dalton started frequently showing up on our screens due to his outstanding recent performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kerry-condon><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kerry Condon</span></h2><p>While many focus on Mike Ehrmantraut and the sweet relationship he has with his granddaughter, Mike's daughter-in-law Stacey Ehrmantraut has played a small, but important role on Better Call Saul. She was often a voice of reason or the bridge between Mike and his granddaughter, as well as the person that often led him to reflect on the loss of his son.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Actress Kerry Condon brought to life this important side-character, and she's quickly gained momentum outside the franchise because of her talents. She started to gain more attention with her role as Molly Sullivan in the Ray Donovan series and the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2017, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she truly broke through</a> in her BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated performance as supporting actress in 2022's The Banshees of Inisherin - which tells the story of two life-long friends and the relationship between them that is abruptly ended by one who wishes to no longer be friends.</p><p>Two projects of hers to keep on our radar are Night Swim, a horror film about a woman who decides to swim in her pool at night and becomes terrorized by a vicious spirit, and the film In the Land of Saints and Sinners, which takes place in an Irish village.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmq6GdXZiutMCMqJ1mmpWpwaa%2BjJyYpaRdqK62uIyhmK%2BdXZ67br%2FTqKmeZZ6axbV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
