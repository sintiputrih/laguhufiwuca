At the end of a few days if it doesn’t show recovery, it means that Luke Perry, when he wasn’t in that ICU bed anymore, he was already in heaven.”</p><p>Pinsky, 60, added that he “knew this was a bad situation” when he learned the former <a href=#>Beverly Hills, 90210</a> star was in a medically induced coma. The former Dr. Drew on Call host explained how it’s an extremely tough call to make for family members, no matter what. He elaborated, “What’s hard for families is when somebody has to come off a ventilator when there’s some possibility of recovery, and you’re trying to make a decision of what kind of recovery would that be, and what kind of life would that be?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/doctors-talk-luke-perry-reelz1.jpg><p>“What did this individual want? Life at any cost? Or would they not want to have lived in a vegetative state? Most people do not want that,” he explained. “But when there’s brain death, that is death. So the decision should be relatively simple, but it’s painful.”</p><p><a href=#>Perry died on March 4 at the age of 52</a>, having <a href=#>never recovered from a “massive” stroke</a> less than a week earlier.
