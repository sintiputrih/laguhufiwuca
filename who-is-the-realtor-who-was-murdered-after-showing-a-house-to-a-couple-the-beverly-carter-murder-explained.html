She’d do the showing, and then she’d bring dinner home. Her husband didn’t know that was the last time they would ever speak.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>The couple, convicted criminal <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arron Lewis</a></strong> and his wife <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crystal Lowery</a></strong>, posed as a married couple who just moved to the area. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">plan all along</a> was to kidnap and demand a ransom for Beverly, because she was “a woman that worked alone – a rich broker.” That plan fell apart quickly due to poor planning and general stupidity.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-to-beverly-carter data-injectable=false>What happened to Beverly Carter?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>It <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was around</a> 6 p.m. on Sept. 25, 2014 when Beverly Carter pulled up to 14202 Old River Drive in the town of Scott, Arkansas. The 50-year-old was a high-volume realtor, with sales of around $12 million the previous year.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>She parked her brown Cadillac SUV in the driveway and waited. When her husband didn’t hear from her for a few hours, he went to the property himself, around 9 p.m. There was the SUV in the driveway, with Beverly’s purse inside. Weirdly, nothing was missing. The door to the residence was ajar, but there was no one around, although he searched the house thoroughly. He contacted police who quickly got to work.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>By the next morning, the house was a full on crime scene, cordoned off with police tape with a forensics vehicle in the driveway. Real estate agencies closed offices for the day and agents prowled the area handing out fliers, hoping for some sort of sign that Beverly was OK. It never came.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>On Sept. 28, three days after Beverly’s disappearance, authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of the 33-year-old Arron Lewis. He was charged with capital murder, robbery and kidnapping. Beverly’s body was found in a shallow grave at a nearby concrete plant. Police said they used cell phone data between Beverly’s phone and her kidnappers to solve the case.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>The line about Beverly being a “just a woman that worked alone?” Arron told that to reporters as he was transported from jail to the sheriff’s office. Details of the case were kept under wraps for months, until Arron’s wife Crystal was arrested.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>She sang like a canary to save her own feathers and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges of first-degree murder and kidnapping in exchange for testifying against her husband. It was Crystal’s testimony that revealed just how harrowing Beverly’s final days turned out to be.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In court</a>, Crystal revealed that Arron wanted to do the kidnapping because he was unemployed, and the couple had broken up and needed to get out of the house. They planned the kidnapping for two weeks, staking out houses that were remote and lacked security.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>Arron’s plan was doomed from the start. He was in possession of a credit card machine, and he would transfer the ransom money to a credit card he’d make with the machine. If you think that plan sounds really dumb, you are right.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>They couple targeted jobs that people did alone – salesperson, mail carrier or, of course, real estate agent. They went with the latter because they thought that’s who would have the most money. They needed someone married. Arron found Beverly online.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>After Lowery bound and gagged Beverly, he put her in the trunk of his car. The plan was to hold her at a nearby concrete plant, but when Arron got to the plant he realized that would be impossible, even though he had staked it out before.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>With nowhere to go, he brought her back to his house and put her in the bathroom. They made Beverly record a voice message, pleading with her husband do what Arron said and not contact police. They never sent the message, opting instead to simply kill her. Beverly’s husband heard the message after his wife’s death.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>The couple wanted money but Beverly didn’t have any, so Arron drove back to the crime scene to get her ATM card. It was impossible though, because there were already authorities everywhere. When asked why she didn’t let Beverly go when Arron left, she said she was more “worried about getting caught.”</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>When Arron came back and relayed the situation at the crime scene, he told Crystal that he had to “take [Beverly] out of the house and take care of things.” (This is per Crystal’s testimony, by the way.)</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>Arron said Beverly may have seen his face, and Crystal was worried that Beverly saw some medicine bottles in the bathroom with her name on them. She hid while Arron removed a terrified Beverly and put her back in the car.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How was Realtor Beverly Carter killed?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>At around 3 a.m., Arron texted Crystal and said “you sure you want me to do this?” She texted back “do whatever you want. Good night.”</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>“I’m asking you,” he replied. She answered angrily: “such a f*****g waste of time. Why don’t you f**k her too?”</p><p data-characters=41 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>“You need to chill,” he said.</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>“Whatever,” she said back. “It don’t take that long to do what you need to do. I’m not helping anymore.”</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">details of the murder</a> are courtesy of deputy prosecutor Barbara Mariani during Arron’s trial. Barbara went through “Unspeakable, terrifying, suffering.”</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>“She died a horrible, terrifying death that no one deserves,” the prosecutor said. “Beverly loved her life. The last thing Beverly experienced was unspeakable terror at that man’s hands.”</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>Arron drove her to the concrete plant and wrapped Beverly’s face in six layers of green duct tape.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>The prosecutor said Beverly took about five minutes to die. She went unconscious after 90 seconds of desperately trying to breathe. It was incredibly painful, and her body convulsed for an additional three minutes, until she was “finally released from that emotional and physical terror by death.”</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>When Arron returned home, he told Crystal “Look, I’m not f****d up about it. I don’t have a conscience. I can turn it of and on like a switch.” He said he walked Beverly to the edge of the grass, and watched her die.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>The couple went to Walmart to buy a shovel and topsoil. They drove back to the body and buried it in a hasty, shallow grave. Then they went to Waffle House.</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true>At the end of the trial, a jury deliberated for less than an hour and brought back a guilty verdict. Arron was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Crystal pleaded to the lesser charges and got 30 years. She recently applied for clemency to shorten her sentence, but it was denied.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>The murder sparked changes to the real estate agency as a whole. The Arkansas Realtors Association now trains realtors on safety practices. It recommends using a buddy system when showing houses, and meeting clients at a neutral location first.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1sHnIrGStoJViv6aty62mq2Wnnbxuw8CsZKatopmys7HDZpifrJWnerS0zrCgp59dlnqpu9SsnGasn2Kubq%2FOrqelnV2ptaZ5wZ6tnqqcrnqkrdGtnKtlnaq%2FpbHRZpyxqJyWtq%2Bxw2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
