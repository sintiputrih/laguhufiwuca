Because of my age and losing the last pregnancy I didn’t want to get attached to this potential baby too quickly.”</p><p>Osian’s first few weeks in the world didn’t come without some challenges.

Every time that I see my [eldest] daughter getting a bit complacent, feeling a little entitled and … treating people in a way that’s not totally respectful, I call and say, ‘Hey let’s stop and talk.’ … I tell her about what’s going on in the world, I tell her how lucky she is and to remember what’s important in this life,” Jovovich explained at the time.</p><p><i>Given the constantly evolving nature of COVID-19,</i><i>&nbsp;</i><i><span class=markzyk4bw9lk data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Us</span><span class=marklzzdaew7v data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Weekly</span>&nbsp;</i><i>wants our readers to have access to the most accurate resources.
