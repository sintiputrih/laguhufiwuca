However, he absolutely detested taking baths, which is a bit unusual for someone who wants to be clean all the time. He has a valid reason, though. Gable never took baths, as he didn't like the fact that he had to sit in bath water filled with filth from his own body.</p><p dir=ltr>Gable's cleanliness was also observed by those around him, one of them being John Mahin, who the actor shared a room with during his time in the Army before he was an actor. According to Mahin, Gable had what he described as a "cleanliness fetish" (via <a href=#>Clark Gable: A Biography</a>). Mahin said that Gable always shaved his armpit and chest hair, explaining to him that he can't stand the excess hair. "You smell with it. It makes you sweat more," Gable said. Mahin also recalled the time when Gable asked him how he can tolerate taking baths: "How can you sit in that tub with all that dirty coming off of you?"&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Gable's obsession with keeping clean was so extreme that he even bought parts and hardware in order to build a portable shower that he can use. Per <a href=#>History Daily</a>, Gable also changed his clothes frequently throughout the day and changed his sheets daily.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAl21sbG1fqbWmedaeoKucXaSvtLHSrKCopl2uvLZ5zZ6tnqpdoLumw4yco5qqm2K0oq7LnmShmZRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
