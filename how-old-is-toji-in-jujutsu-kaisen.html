Recommended Videos For a large portion of the Jujutsu Kaisen story, the families of the protagonists have remained a mystery. While we may know that Yuji grew up under his grandfather’s care and that Megumi is part of the Zenin clan, we still know very little about the families of these characters.
Even the three big clans have maintained an air of secrecy surrounding them."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So, how old is Toji really?</p><h2 id=h-how-old-is-toji data-injectable=false>How old is Toji?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Toji-Jujutsu-Kaisen.jpg><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>The lines around Toji’s eyes may be evidence, but they’re not necessarily a sign of his age. In reality, Toji’s birth year was never confirmed, though his birthday is listed as Dec. 31. Still, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">many fans theorized</a> that Toji must have been in his 20s when he passed away, likely based on his appearance or actions. That being said, I and other fans are not entirely sure if this is right.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>Considering Gojo is currently 28 years old, it means that 12 years have passed since he killed Toji. Yet, this wasn’t the first time the duo met. During the 2nd episode, we see a six-year-old Gojo meeting Toji for the first time, who is assumed to have been around 20 years old. Considering their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fight occurred 10 years after they met</a>, Toji must’ve been around 30 years old when he died.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>Taking this information into consideration, it would mean that Megumi — who is currently 15 — was only three years old when his father was fatally killed by his professor, Gojo. This goes against the belief that he was six years old.</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>Considering his physical prowess and already having a child, Toji couldn’t have been much older than his early-thirties. Still, he was still relatively older than Gojo at the time of their fateful encounter.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Of course, take this information with a grain of salt – after all, I am a writer, not a mathematician. Still, in the end, Toji still had plenty to offer to Megumi, but his life was cut significantly short due to his ambition, arrogance, and most of all – his desire to prove himself stronger than his highly toxic family.</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Jujutsu Kaisen is available on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6hprBln6GxbrXSZquooplitq95ya6hrqyjqnqsrcisnKdn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
