The closest thing is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twilight Hall</a>, which is part of a network of buildings within the city of Berdusk and even this is not known to every group member, as sometimes Harpers operate completely on their own or in small cells which are not necessarily aware of others who are nearby their locations.</p><p data-characters=518 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>Whether we will see more of the group — or the fact its members are more often women — in a sequel remains to be seen. The directors of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves are up for it, though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they say</a> they were not planning for a franchise, and, if one were to happen, they would hope to stick with the same cast and characters in order to jump into a new story quickly. So, we could see Pine’s Edgin again, and, if so, they just may give him the ability to use some magic while on a new adventure.</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>A television show is also being planned for Paramount Plus and it has a series order already, so stay tuned.
