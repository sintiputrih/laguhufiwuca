When there isn't enough food to go around, sharks swim past each other, slapping the surface of the water with their tails.

She was filmed off Mexico's Guadalupe Island in 2013.</span><span class=credit>Global_Pics/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Out Of Water Shark" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/out-of-water-shark.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Not too much is known about the mating habits of great white sharks. What is known is that after mating the female develops several eggs which hatch in her womb. There, newly-hatched shark pups feed on unfertilized eggs.</span><span class=credit>Elizabeth Hoffmann/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Interesting Great White Shark Facts" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/great-white-shark-breech.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Great whites have such acute senses that they can smell one drop of blood in 100 liters of water, or a seal colony up to two miles away. They can even detect another animal's electromagnetic field.</span><span class=credit>Carl De Souza/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Hierarchy For Great Whites" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/great-white-shark-depth-recorddorsalfinedotcom.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>While great white sharks are loners, there is a degree of social hierarchy. Females often dominate males. Sometimes sharks will bite each other as a show of strength, but cannibalism is rare.</span><span class=credit>George Probst/Flickr</span> <img alt="When Great White Sharks Attack Humans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jump-great-white-shark-food.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Great white sharks rarely attack humans, even when one is swimming nearby. The human blood usually only spills when sharks "test-bite": bite something to see if it's food. When the shark realizes it is tasting human flesh, it usually swims away, which is why most attacks aren't fatal.</span><span class=credit>USO/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Where Great Whites Live" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/great-white-fullbody-.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Great whites prefer warm, salty water, typically residing in Australia, South Africa, California and the northeastern United States. Still, they have been known to dive to chilly depths of 820 feet.</span><span class=credit>Elias Levy/Flickr</span> <img alt="Head Of A Great White" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/great-white-shark-head.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Believe it or not, the great white's biggest threat is human interaction. Sharks are hunted for their fins and teeth, and are often the victims of bycatch -- when they're caught in the nets of commercial fishermen.</span><span class=credit>Ryan Pierse/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Great White Shark Facts About Their Tongue" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/great-white-shark-blue.jpg> <span class=caption-body>The great white shark's tongue is absolutely worthless. Called the basihyal, the tough piece of cartilage sits on the floor of the shark's mouth, and usually doesn't move.</span><span class=credit>Elias Levy/Flickr</span> <img alt="Great White Shark Seal" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/great-white-shark-seal.jpg> <span class=caption-body>The great white shark is an exemplar of industrious efficiency: it can eat a sea lion whole, after which point it doesn't need to eat again for another three months.</span><span class=credit>Carl De Souza/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Orca Whales And Great White Sharks" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/teeth-bite-shark.jpg> <span class=caption-body>The only animal known to prey on great white sharks is the orca whale. The orca flips the shark on its back, rendering it immobile and thus defenseless. Last year, tourists in Australia witnessed a pod of orcas circle a lone great white and kill him with continuous body slams.</span><span class=credit>Elizabeth Hoffmann/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Great White Shark Teeth" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/great-white-shark-teeth.png> <span class=caption-body>Sharks don't chew. Instead, they use their serrated teeth to shred their prey into tiny pieces. And about those teeth: Great whites have 300 at a time, and loose about 1000 over a lifetime. When they loose teeth, a new row slides into place, like a conveyor belt for their mouths.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span> <img alt="Weight Of A Great White" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/great-white-face-flickr.jpg> <span class=caption-body>The great white shark typically weighs anywhere from 1,500 to 2,400 pounds -- the liver alone can take up about 24 percent of that figure. Despite their weight, their torpedo-shaped bodies and powerful tails propel them through the water at 15 miles per hour.</span><span class=credit>Discovery Channel/Flickr</span> <img alt="Great White Shark Eating" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/great-white-shark-eating.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Great whites need to be left in the wild. In January 2016, Japan's Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium tried to keep a great white shark in captivity. The shark became disoriented, banging into the walls of his enclosure. He refused to eat and died just three days later.</span><span class=credit>Lwp Kommunikáció/Flickr</span><p>Next, read more unbelievable <a href=#>shark facts</a>.
