We won the money, but we didn’t even think of that. We definitely talked about giving back,” Hannah said, admitting she had a lot of thoughts and emotions at once.</p><p>Marco explained they took things “day by day” while living in the villa and said he viewed it as “I get another day with [Hannah]” every time America voted for them to stick around.</p><p>Since they were “boyfriend and girlfriend,” Maura asked them if they’d exchanged numbers. They admitted they hadn’t, with Marco indicating they already would have if they had their phones there.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hannah and Marco are Love Island USA 5 winners</h2><p>While speaking with Maura, Hannah admitted one of her favorite moments during the season was getting to return from Casa because she was “going through it” mentally at that time.</p><p>That highlight moment arrived as Marco’s ex-girlfriend was brought into the mix, making things extra stressful for Hannah to learn about from afar.</p><p>“You never know what to expect in here,” she said, adding, “So that was a lot, especially because we were going so good.”</p><p>Hannah said when she saw Marco again, she told herself, “I really gotta trust in this man” as they continued their relationship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Marco, 22, was one of the initial contestants introduced in the villa in just the first episode of Season 5.
