Joseph Fiennes’ wife, Maria Dieguez, isn’t keen on watching her hubby play the villain in The Handmaid’s Tale.
“When they eventually kill me off, then she’ll watch the show,” Fiennes, 48, exclusively told Us Weekly at the Governor’s Ball following the 2018 Emmy Awards on Monday, September 17. “But she’s not going there until then!”
Fiennes, who stars in the hit Hulu series as Commander Fred Waterford, also reflected on the second season’s controversial finale in which Elisabeth Moss (June Osborne) stays behind in the dystopia Gilead after helping her daughter escape."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So I get it. But she’s been damaged so much in the regime, to back in there and save her own kinda makes sense to me. I know a lot of people are confused, but as a parent, I got it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Commander-Waterford.jpg><p class=p1>In <i>The Handmaid’s Tale</i>, Moss’ character, June, was separated from her husband and daughter when a religious group took over the government and established a new country, Gilead, where fertile women like June serve as handmaids to carry children for government leaders and their wives. June is assigned to work for Commander Waterford and his wife, Serena, with whom she has a complicated relationship.</p><p class=p1>Fiennes’ costar <a href=#><strong>Madeline Brewer</strong></a>, who plays Janine on the show, also spoke with <i>Us </i>about next season. “I just want Janine to kick some ass. I want an action sequence,” she said while walking the golden carpet earlier in the day, later noting that the second season’s finale took her by surprise. “I screamed. I was at our finale event and I grabbed Nina [Kiri], screaming, tears streaming down my face.”</p><p class=p1>Brewer previously gave her two cents while attending the BAFTA Tea Party in Beverly Hills on Saturday, September 15, sponsored by Heineken.</p><p class=p1>“I think this season will rely heavily on resistance and that’s what the show’s about anyway. I’m excited to see how they play it out,” she told <i>Us</i>. “It’s not an eye for an eye in Janine’s world. It’s, like, an eye for a life. No, I’m kidding. I really just want to see her, like, find her power and, like, really own it and help Mayday, help the resistance.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>The Handmaid’s Tale </i>also stars <strong>Yvonne Strahovski</strong>, <strong>Max Minghella</strong>,<strong> Ann Dowd</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Alexis Bledel</strong></a>.
