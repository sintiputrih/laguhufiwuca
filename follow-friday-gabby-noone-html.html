This is almost two years old, but I think it holds up. It takes you on a real wild ride in less than 140 characters. I wrote this while feeling really weary about the way people ask famous women “Are you a feminist?” and then a bunch of people get mad at her regardless of whether her answer is yes or no. And then there are bunch of followup think pieces like, “What *IS* feminism?” Like, we should all chill for a sec and go listen to the Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie portion of Beyonce’s “Flawless.” Mainstream feminism has excluded so many women for so long, so I understand why some might shy away from identifying with it, but I think all women would agree that my definition here is correct.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzei11o0a4qph84s38e4jom@published data-word-count=20><strong>Do you have any other favorite styles, like the DIY tutorial, that you like to play with in your tweets?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzei11o0a4rph847czdsqhj@published data-word-count=31>Sometimes I like riffing off of that like relatable teen tone. Like tweets that are like “Tfw….” but instead followed by a situation that’s really specific and not relatable at all.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzei11o0a4sph84aouipgtn@published data-word-count=25><strong>Since you mentioned 140 characters – How do you feel about the character limit and how, if at all, does it affect your writing process?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzei11o0a4tph84i6js1y75@published data-word-count=41>I tend to speak in incomplete sentences and trail off when I’m talking IRL, so Twitter has been good for me. If I can’t make something short enough to be a tweet, that usually means I haven’t thought about it enough.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>i was banned from Yelp because some community members were tired of my "scathing feminist critiques" but this isn't the end of me</p>— Gabby Noone (@twelveoclocke) <a href=#>January 13, 2015</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzei11o0a4vph84fwyxbyrk@published data-word-count=124>Wow looks like I’m obsessed with talking about feminism on the Internet! Anyways, Yelp is my favorite website. When I have trouble falling asleep, I will read Yelp reviews of places I never plan on going in faraway towns. The best thing is when you read a juicy Yelp review and then click through the writer’s profile and find out they’ve reviewed like every business they’ve ever frequented. It paints a rich tapestry of a person’s life. This tweet is a lie though because I don’t actually post Yelp reviews because I don’t wanna get too vulnerable in front of strangers. Like any true starlet, I need to keep some things private so I reserve my opinions of restaurants for my close inner circle.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzei11o0a4wph84s42wqfli@published data-word-count=26><strong>Do you (or did you ever) feel vulnerable when you post stuff on Twitter? Has that changed for you in the time you’ve been on Twitter?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzei11o0a4xph8487xj9mud@published data-word-count=93>I made my Twitter when I was 15 (!!!) and now I’m 21, so I am sure if I dug deep I’d find some tweets like “h8 everyone but can’t w8 4 to see the new Twilight movie w/ my girlies.” As I’ve gotten older, I think I’ve become more critical about what is a worthy tweet. I’m very much myself on Twitter, but I usually avoid sharing mundane details or complaints about my life because I figure everyone has enough of those already and I should probably just call my mom instead.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>❒ Taken.<br>❒ Single.<br>✔ Too busy figuring out how to lead a glamorous yet menacing lifestyle on a modest budget to even think about love</p>— Gabby Noone (@twelveoclocke) <a href=#>August 21, 2014</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzei11o0a4zph844rx6zsvv@published data-word-count=68>I don’t really think of myself as a comedic writer because mostly everything I write is something I thought in earnest that translates as kinda funny to other people. This tweet is honestly how I feel and I’m glad people related to it. I’m over self-deprecation humor that’s like “CAN YOU BE TOO SINGLE??? MY NETFLIX ACCOUNT SAYS YES.” I’m trying to make aggressively glamorous humor a thing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzei11o0a50ph84nhcmvjgx@published data-word-count=14><strong>What’s the most surprised you’ve been at a reaction to any of your tweets?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzei11o0a51ph84411ipg3s@published data-word-count=75>I wrote <a href=#>this serious tweet about Kim Kardashian</a> and now it is my most popular tweet of all time! I don’t think I’m the first person to make this observation about her, so I’m surprised it got such a response. Maybe it’s the all caps that were so effective. I really hope I meet Kim K one day. I have this elaborate fantasy where we discuss conspiracy theories over large salads at a luxury restaurant.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzei11o0a52ph84jqqtz29b@published data-word-count=15><strong>Are there any other subgenres of humor that you’d like to see become more widespread?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzei11o0a53ph84eb4ihsme@published data-word-count=52>I don’t know about any other subgenres, but I would like to see stronger jokes about Food Network stars. As a society, we need to step up our game in that area. Like, just comparing Guy Fieri to a plate of Ed Hardy scented chili fries is just a hack move nowadays.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzei11o0a54ph84hdc7efmn@published data-word-count=13><a href=#>Jenny Nelson</a> lives and writes in Brooklyn and works at Funny or Die.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Gabby Noone (@twelveoclocke) Talks About Twitter and […]</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobmdgaHynu8ulprBllqe2pa3YZp6ampKueq%2B7zqecZ6Ckork%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
