We were just as surprised as you will be to hear that a massive gaming franchise is joining the TUDUM platform’s gaming catalog with three classic titles available to play without extra charge for all subscribers.</p><h2 id=h-sofia-vergara-looks-unrecognizable-in-the-first-official-trailer-for-netflix-cartel-drama-griselda data-injectable=false>Sofia Vergara looks unrecognizable in the first official trailer for Netflix cartel drama Griselda</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>The first trailer for Griselda, the Netflix mini-series about the infamous Colombian drug lord Griselda Blanco, dropped Thursday, revealing a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">completely transformed</a> Sofía Vergara in what is her biggest role since Modern Family. “Quinnpin. Innovator. Mother. Killer. Griselda,” the trailer flashes in big bold letters, just as big and bold as the show’s protagonist.</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=866 data-injectable=true>The 6-episode-long series from the creators of Narcos and Narcos: Mexico Doug Miro and Eric Newman, has a release date set for January 25 on Netflix. Miro wrote all six episodes, while Andrés Baiz, who also worked on the duo’s two cartel-world shows, comes back to direct. Vergara is a producer in addition to her starring role, and will share the screen with Martín Rodríguez, Rosa Ochoa, Desiree Alexandra Estrada, Juliana Aidén Martinez, and a number of other actors.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 2 of The Sandman is finally back on track after strikes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/the-sandman-dream.png><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>The Sandman author Neil Gaiman announced Thursday that the second season of the live-action adaptation of his comic book series was resuming filming after it had been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">halted by the Writers and Actors strikes</a>. Gaiman praised “genius” showrunner Allan Heinberg for his vision for the show and teased new settings for the upcoming season, including Ancient Greece and revolutionary France.</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>The first season was a huge hit on Netflix in 2022, receiving praise for successfully adapting the notoriously tricky source material, and topping the Nielsen streaming charts. The Sandman follows Morpheus, who is the personification of dreams and also known as Dream, after he breaks free from captivity and attempts to restore his powers. Season 2 has not been given an official release date by Netflix yet.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Your time won’t be “Wasted” playing GTA on Netflix</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Grand-Theft-Auto-The-Trilogy-The-Definitive-Edition.jpg><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>The biggest streaming service in the world is pairing up with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games</a> to bring one of the most famous video games ever into its gaming fold.

The 8-season-long series follows a seven-member elite force tasked with stopping a terrorist attack in Las Vegas, but the real threat comes after they’re all <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">too drunk and high</a> from celebrating their first big win to stop a second threat.</p><p data-characters=748 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>‘s Daniel Fienberg calls the show “rambling and digressive,” critiquing its dragged-out jokes and lengthy fight sequences, while Aramide Tinubu of Variety bashes Obliterated as a “nearly unwatchable hodgepodge of nonsense littered with penises and explosives.” In fairness, we do have a feeling that Hurwitz, Schlossberg, and Heald will take that as a compliment. It’s not all bad, though. For Collider, Nate Richard highlights the first four episodes of the season as “a lot of fun,” despite it “peaking too soon” and dragging in the end stretch. Still, knowing Netflix users, poor reviews won’t stop them from making this sausage bomb fest a Top 10 resident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsGnuMixZqWZpJrAtXnNnqufpJmteq%2Bx1qxkrKeWnq5uwsSrnpqqkah6sb7OrKuhnaSesG66zqycZqGeYrSztdKeo52ZXZy2t7HSZpmrmZShsrp5wqimqZ2iYq5uvtSnZJ%2BnomK1qr%2BMpqannalirrR5zZ6unqukYrOzu8xmmqiaopZ6rK3IZpqrnZGpvLO%2FjJ%2BYpaSjYryvecitqmaekZiycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
