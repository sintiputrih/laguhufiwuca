Long referred to her as lovely and admired her ability to defend herself.</p><p>Theodore Robert Rufus Long (born September 15, 1947) is an American retired professional wrestling referee. Furthermore, he is a manager and authority figure best known for his work in the NWA, WCW, and WWE. Theodore Long, aka Teddy Long, began his career with the National Wrestling Alliance.</p><p>He began his WWE (then-World Wrestling Federation) career as a referee in 1998. Teddy became an on-screen manager in 2003. Later, he served as SmackDown’s general manager for two six-year periods and as ECW’s general manager. In 2017, Ron Simmons and John Layfield inducted him into the WWE Hall of Fame.</p><h2>Teddy Long’s Dating Life</h2><p>After some backstage flirtation, Long was cast as Kristal Marshall’s on-screen lover in April 2007. On May 25, 2007, he hired Vickie Guerrero as his new assistant to spend more time with Kristal, partly due to Kristal’s advice. Long proposed to Kristal on the June 22, 2007, episode of SmackDown, and she initially fled the ring in tears before accepting to marry him.</p><p>Ron Simmons was picked as the best man for “Theodore Rufus Long” and Kristal’s wedding on the July 27, 2007 episode of SmackDown. The wedding was scheduled for September 21, 2007, in Long’s hometown of Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p>Furthermore, the ceremony was continually disturbed and left unfinished when Teddy suffered a heart attack moments before saying “I do,” putting him in a coma. The intended plot did not come to an acceptable conclusion since Marshall left WWE shortly after, citing creative issues.</p><h2>Teddy Long And Nia Jax</h2><p>WWE star Teddy Long has stated that he hopes his “girlfriend” Nia Jax wins the Women’s Royal Rumble match on Saturday night. Many fans assumed Teddy Long and Nia Jax were in a relationship based on how Teddy described her on an episode of The Wrestling Time Machine.</p><p>Teddy Long lauded Rhea Ripley, the Women’s World Champion, during an appearance on The Wrestling Time Machine podcast. Later, Long jokingly referred to Jax as his girlfriend and predicted that she would win the Women’s Royal Rumble match.</p><p><strong>Rhea Ripley, my God. She is doing an excellent job. This lady is extraordinary. I rarely sit and watch things. I’ll watch, but I’ll quickly move on to anything else. But she can seduce me. I’ve seen her promos; she’s excellent in the ring and has what it takes.To return to my girlfriend Nia Jax, I earlier told her that if she didn’t receive this thing, I would kick her out. “So Nia is bringing it home.”</strong></p><p>Teddy and Nia have made no public declarations confirming their connection, and no other source has done so.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Wrestler</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Glow Up Sarah Wikipedia, Age And Net Worth Partner 2023</a></h3>The fifth season of Britain's Next Make-Up Star has begun.
