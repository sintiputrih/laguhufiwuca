Not only do they “do everything together,” but Brayden runs to the real estate agent when she and his dad pick him up from school.</p><p>“They play tennis together. They cuddle, they just absolutely adore each other,” El Moussa, who also shares daughter Taylor, 10, with Anstead, 37, told Us. “Honestly, for me as a dad, I am so happy. I’m so excited about getting married, especially because she’s such an amazing stepmom to the kids.

It’s so fun to watch their curious minds and teach them life lessons and watch them grow and learn. I’ve been close with Tay from the beginning, it took longer for me to build a bond with Bray, but now we are besties.”</p><p>The Netflix star concluded, “If you would have told me 18 months ago, I’d be a bonus mama AKA (soon-to-be-stepmama) I’d say, ‘Yeah right!!!!’ And now look raising two amazing kids with my sweet love who is such an incredible daddy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She and El Moussa<a href=#> started dating in 2019</a>, two years after his divorce from Anstead.
