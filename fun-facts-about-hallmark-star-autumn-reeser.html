Turtle, Vince, Ari and the gang needed a bit of new blood; Autumn was the perfect girl for the job! Her character, <a href=#>Lizzie Grant</a>,&nbsp;was part of the Miller Gold TV department, working with neurotic agent Ari Gold. Lizzie's main plot-line? Once her relationship with a co-worker is exposed, Lizzie leaves Ari's agency and they become enemies. Yes girl, Ari is a bully!</p><p>Autumn spoke with <a href=#>Page Six</a> in 2010 about the show, and how much she enjoys her character.&nbsp;"I got very little info before the season started," she explained. "A lot of it I discovered when I read each week's script. I got hints here and there, but it's so much better than I expected it to be." When Page Six asked if her character on "The O.C.," Taylor Townsend, would be friends with Lizzie Grant, Autumn explained, "No! Not at all – I think Lizzie would eat her alive. I don't think Lizzie has many girlfriends. She doesn't need them. I think she likes women, but she's independent, her own person and feels that she doesn't need anyone else. But I have my theories about what Taylor is doing right now."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhlboJ1fo6frKdllpawtb%2BMmpmoraRitaK4y6aYq6NdqMGivoyarK2tnaN6s7HErJyrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
