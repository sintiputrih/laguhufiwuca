Concern became more widespread when he missed his cohosting gig with <a href=#><strong>Kelly Ripa</strong></a> the next morning. At the time, Ripa, 49, reassured viewers that Seacrest was simply “taking the morning off” after a late night of work on Idol.</p><p>A source later confirmed to Us that <a href=#>Seacrest “did not have a stroke”</a> on the show. His publicist continued to clear the air in a statement to <a href=#>People</a> magazine, addressing the host’s swollen eyes and struggle to speak.</p><p>“Like many people right now, Ryan is <a href=#>adjusting to the new normal</a> and finding work-home balance, with the added stress of having to put on live shows from home,” the rep explained on May 18. “Between Live With Kelly and Ryan, American Idol, On Air With Ryan Seacrest, and the Disney Family Singalong specials, he has been juggling three-four on-air jobs over the last few weeks and he’s in need of rest. So today he took a well-deserved day off.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The following day, Seacrest returned to Live with a message of gratitude for his fans and close friend <a href=#><strong>Mark Consuelos</strong></a>, who filled in for him while he caught up on his rest.</p><p>“He’s so good at it!” he joked of Ripa’s husband at the top of the show. “Also, [thanks for] all the <a href=#>very kind well-wishes</a> for my exhaustion, working around the clock.”</p><p>For more on Seacrest’s plans to return to NYC, watch the video above and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarsZGjerSxwJypnqukYsSquMtmqZ6spae7bsDOZqWym12bvLN5y6KtnmWUmsCxtdOeZKanppp6s8HMqKmsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
