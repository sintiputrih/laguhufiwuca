While divorce can breed contempt in a child, Karsen Liotta was exceptionally close with her father. Therefore, news of his death landed hard on the aspiring actor. Here's how Karsen Liotta has been healing and moving forward since her father's tragic passing.</p><h2 id=karsen-liotta-and-ray-39-s-fiancee-jay-nittolo-have-been-honoring-his-legacy>Karsen Liotta And Ray's Fiancee Jay Nittolo Have Been Honoring His Legacy</h2><p>First and foremost, Karsen Liotta, as well as her late father's fiancee, Jay Nittolo, have been actively honoring the Goodfellas actor since his passing. This included showing up to the premiere of one of his last films, Cocaine Bear, in early 2023 in his stead. She also honored her father at the 2023 Critic's Choice Awards where he was nominated. Additionally, they were present when Ray Liotta posthumously earned a star on The Hollywood Walk Of Fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/th-image-template-1.jpg><p>During the ceremony, Karsen said, "He was a one-of-a-kind actor and the best friend, brother, and father that anyone could ask for."</p><p>The relationship that Karsen shared with her father is well-publicized. For one, Karsen has never been silent about her adoration for Ray on Instagram. This includes copious Father's Day posts about how wonderful a dad Ray was are all over her Instagram.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ray Liotta Gave Some Chilling Advice During His Final Interview</a></span></p><p>Karsen Liotta, who is also an actor and model, would often post images of her attending red-carpet functions with her father. In fact, the very first image she ever posted on Instagram (back in 2013) was of her as a little girl embracing her dad. It was accompanied by the caption, "Happy birthday Dadüíõ you're the best & I love you!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-karsen-liotta-doing-now>What Is Karsen Liotta Doing Now?</h2><p>There's no doubt that Karsen Liotta has done her best to keep her personal life private in the year following her father's tragic death. While she has attended numerous Hollywood functions in his honor, she hasn't posted nearly as much to Instagram as she did when he was still alive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ray-liotta-daughter-karsen-liotta-hot.jpg><p>Karsen, who is 24 at the time of this writing, tended to post images typical of a young woman her age. This includes pictures of her partying with her friends, showing off her incredible figure in swimwear, and the occasional sunset. But given Karsen's connection to the film industry and her career in acting and modeling, she also posted a ton of images of her on set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many of these images snagged the attention of other daughters of Hollywood royalty, such as Lily Mo Sheen (Kate Beckinsale and Michael Sheen's daughter), Sylvester Stallone's daughter Scarlett, and Bill Lawrence and Christa Miller's superstar daughter, Charlotte Lawrence.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Why Fans Called Will Smith's Daughter The Most Talented Nepo Baby Of Her Generation</a></span></p><p>Karsen Liotta has only posted three images on Instagram since her father's death in May 2022. One is a set of red carpet images from the Critics DChoice Awards with the caption, "Such a beautiful day honoring my Dad‚Äôs nomination at the Critics Choice Awards ‚ú® Thank you so much to <a href=#>@chanelofficial</a> for dressing me in this stunning dress üíï Thank you so much to the dream team <a href=#>@allanface</a> for my makeup and <a href=#>@giocampora</a> for my hair ‚ù§Ô∏è"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ray-liotta-daughter-karsen-liotta-taron-egerton.jpg><p>Another depicts her preparing for the same award show, while the other is of her sunbathing on the roof of a home in Los Angeles. All of the images have garnered an incredible amount of comments from fans still sending their condolences. But with Karsen's level of secrecy regarding her personal life there's no doubt fans are concerned about her. Some of the comments simply ask. "How are you doing?"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Often Does Jeremy Renner Actually See His Daughter Ava After His Split From Sonni Pacheco?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Karsen Liotta also had a career trajectory that appears to have been put on hold or stalled since her father's passing. Between 2016 and 2022 alone, Karsen starred in Pretty Face, Trump's America, Mississippi Requiem, Nobodies, Shades of Blue (which starred her father), a couple of short films, Teenage Badass, Hubie Halloween with Adam Sandler, and the acclaimed mini-series, Black Bird which also featured her legendary dad.</p><p>But since Black Bird, Karsen has not been attached to any other project. She also hasn't been doing nearly as much modeling as she once was. However, at the time of this writing, Karsen is still very much in the grieving process and therefore should be given a little more time to reform her life in the way that best suits her.</p><h2 id=who-is-karsen-liotta-39-s-boyfriend>Who Is Karsen Liotta's Boyfriend?</h2><p>At the time of this writing, almost nothing is known about Karsen Liotta's personal life. She's also been incredibly selective about who she posts images with on social media. While it's apparent that she has a ton of close friends since high school, it's unclear if she has a boyfriend or not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Who-Is-Ray-Liottas-Daughter_-Karsen_-And-What-Does-She-Do.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TVGuideTime claimed</a> that she was dating LA realtor Stefan Samorski. The little evidence that was cited was now deleted Instagram posts, making it extremely hard to verify the information. If Karsen was dating Stefan Samorski, it's unlikely that they are still together given the lack of his presence on her feed. They also don't appear to follow each other on Instagram.</p><p>However, one image of the two of them does exist on the internet. And it does appear as though they are romantically involved. However, this is just not enough evidence to confirm a relationship. For now, Karsen Liott'as personal life remains a mystery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edGasGakmaTBta3SZpuarZedwaa%2BjKSYq6uVo3qlu8innmaZlqmys3nHnqlmnpGptaa%2B0marq5mXnrBusMSaq6Fn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
