Andy Cohen revealed she was asked but firmly declined.</p><p>Instead, Lexi will <a href=#>spill details to those who pay for it via Cameo.</a> Yes, she has promised to dish what she can without violating her contract for a price.</p><p>While she may not be at the reunion show, Lexi has said so much since the season began. Let’s take a look at everything she’s said so far.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lexi addresses her work ethic and declares she’s carrying the show</h2><p>Despite what was shown on-screen, Lexi claims she was a good worker. The problem was not with her but rather the lack of stews, which Lexi said should be four on the size of the Lady Michelle yacht.</p><p>Then as ratings for Season 6 continued to climb, Lexi insisted Bravo owed her a raise since she was “carrying the show.”. Lexi’s bad behavior and villainous ways were definitely a pivotal story for the current season.</p><p>During an Instagram Story Q&A declaring <a href=#>she deserved more money,</a> Lexi first shared she was too busy to attend the reunion.</p><p>The fired stew also accused bosun Malia White of being fake when comforting Lexi over her father’s death. Lexi insisted it was all for Malia to shine a positive light on her bad reputation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lexi blasts Bravo for encouraging harassment and giving her a bad edit on Below Deck Med</h2><p>Along with defending herself, Lexi has called out <a href=#>Bravo for allowing harassment </a>that led to her receiving death threats. She shared via Instagram Stories that she was bringing awareness to the bullying she endured.</p><p>Next up, Lexi called out production for giving her a bad edit. In one Instagram Q&A session, she shared messages from Below Deck Mediterranean viewers showing support for her. The former Miss Bahamas <a href=#>warned future cast members</a> that the producers and network do not support them once filming is done.</p><p>Lexi even <a href=#>blasted executive producer Nadine Rajabi</a> for sending her a DM to say all cast members were edited fairly. <a href=#>Hannah Ferrier rushed to defend Nadine</a> after Lexi made her accusations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What has Lexi said about Below Deck Mediterranean Season 6 crew?</h2><p>There’s no doubt Lexi was an outcast with the Lady Michelle crew. The tension didn’t end when Captain Sandy Yawn fired her either.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>David Pascoe slammed Lexi, claiming she was lying on social media about a beach picnic, where Lexi blamed all the issues on Katie Flood and Courtney Veale.<a href=#> Lexi blasted David for his words</a> then told him to stay in his department.</p><p>After her final fight with chef Mathew Shea, where they each said horrific things to each other, Lexi claimed <a href=#>he was obsessed with her.</a> She even said she was getting a restraining order against him.</p><p>Wowza! Lexi Wilson has certainly had a lot to say about Below Deck Med Season 6, Bravo, producers, and her colleagues.</p><p>Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9/8c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5yaxap5xaumpmWSmrmww4ydnJyjXaKypXnHnqmeq12aw6a%2B2K2foqaXYsCpsdJmqpqhlGKuo7vUrWSbqpGrvG6%2Fx6iuZpmemXq0scCspqdlZmKws7HWaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
