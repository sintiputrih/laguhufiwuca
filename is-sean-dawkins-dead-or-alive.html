He was the second wide receiver to be selected at that point. During his third season with the Colts, they managed to win two playoff games, but their journey was halted by a loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship game. Although he participated in two more playoff matches throughout his career, both ended in defeats.</p><p>After spending a single season with the New Orleans Saints, Dawkins became a free agent and signed with the Seattle Seahawks in 1999. It turned out to be one of his most successful individual years, as he made 58 catches for a total of 992 yards. Following his two seasons with Seattle, he concluded his career with the Jacksonville Jaguars. However, his performance was visibly declining during this period, as evident from his mere 20 receptions in that particular season. Just before the start of the 2002 season, he joined the Minnesota Vikings, but unfortunately, he was released during the final roster cuts and thus didn’t have the chance to play in the NFL again.</p><p><strong>Read this also: <a href=#>Sixto Rodriguez Died: Know Everything About his Life</a></strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 data-inserter-version=2></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Obituary_And_Funeral_Arrangements></span>Obituary And Funeral Arrangements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The details of Sean Dawkins’s obituary and arrangements for his funeral will be provided at a later time.
