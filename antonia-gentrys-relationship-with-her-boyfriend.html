However, these are not the only benefits that the series offers.&nbsp;The show addresses prejudice, mental health difficulties, and sexual orientation, as well as youthful angst and troubles.&nbsp;While Ginny has guy difficulties, Gentry’s love life seems to be drama-free. Everything we know about her personal life and relationship is included here.</p><h2>Antonia Gentry’s Boyfriend Relationship</h2><p>Gentry and Pounds have been dating since 2012, according to Pop Sugar.&nbsp;The couple apparently met and began dating at Davidson Fine Arts High School. During Valentine’s Day in 2019, they made their romance Instagram official.&nbsp;“To my love forever, I wish you a very happy Valentine’s Day. Big things are heading your way at a breakneck pace. I’ll be there for you every step of the way, “During the important occasion, Gentry’s boyfriend sent her a letter.</p><p>Gentry’s 22nd birthday is on September 25, 2019, and the composer has devoted a nice message to him. He praised her work ethic and said Gentry was one of the most ambitious and creative artists who had inspired him.&nbsp;In a separate Instagram post, Pounds praised Gentry’s Netflix series.&nbsp;He shared his joy for his “best friend, soulmate, and girlfriend,” Ginny and Georgia, and invited all of his followers to see it when it appeared.&nbsp;Since announcing their romance, the two have shared several photos of themselves on social media.&nbsp;However, they have now erased the majority of the postings, presumably to keep their connection private.</p><h2>&nbsp;Antonia Gentry’s Boyfriend Ezra, as revealed on Music Pounds’</h2><p>Antonia Gentry’s boyfriend Ezra is an Atlanta-based music producer and composer. In a June 2021 interview with The Music Enthusiast Blog, the singer discussed his creative path and his current song, ‘Bestfriend.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Antonia-Gentry-1.jpg><p>Pounds claims that he has been a musician for as long as he can remember. He began playing violin and piano at the age of 11 and got passionate about music when he entered high school. Ezra eventually enrolled at Georgia State University to study music. He learned how to record and create songs while studying music technology. Because it was difficult for the musician to get into the music business, his major employment was to provide individual violin and piano lessons to students. In regards to his tune ‘Bestfriend,’ he said that he created the song’s rhythm in early 2019 but did not utilize it at the time. He returned to his tasks around a year later and discovered the beat during quarantine. He worked on it and finished the song, which will be released in July 2021. The artist claimed that the song was inspired by particular persons in his life.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYp6yfo7aiecaepa2qqah6s7HLmquip56otaq8jLCgraBdnbKzecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
