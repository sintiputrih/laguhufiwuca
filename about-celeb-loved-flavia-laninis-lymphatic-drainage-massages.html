Once that is done, you sit in an infrared sauna for 15 to 20 minutes and then shower. It helps purify, firm and tone your skin,” she says</span>.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Once you’ve booked a coveted appointment at Lanini’s Beauty Institute (she only sees five&nbsp;</span>to six clients a day), she recommends eating a lot before receiving either service, but keeping your choices clean: “Have something light like a salad, chicken or fish and avoid alcohol.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Selena-Gomez-Lymphatic-Drainage-Masseuse-Inline-1.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Next, you can expect to sit back and relax as Lanini massages your body with a caffeine-infused lotion from Brazil used to help speed up circulation and prevent cellulite.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I take my client’s personal needs into account when they come in. The massage is almost the same for everyone, but some people are looking for more of a focus on the belly or the arms,” she dishes.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I think it has become so popular because there isn’t a massage like it anywhere else. My technique is all about applying a little more pressure in order to remove the toxins inside. I don’t use a lot of my fingers and instead, I use more of my hands and I move everything in an upward motion.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>One thing you shouldn’t anticipate is any sort of discomfort. “Lymphatic drainage massages are never supposed to hurt. The whole purpose is to relax your muscles and if you feel pain, your muscles contract and the toxins go inside and the whole point is lost. You don’t need to feel pain in a massage to see the results.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>After your hour to hour and a half long treatment is done — feeling better from the inside out is bound to happen. “My girls say that I have good hands and that they feel lighter and happier after a session,'” Lanini explains.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Selena-Gomez-Lymphatic-Drainage-Masseuse-Inline-2.jpg><p class=p1>“They also find that they sleep very well after a treatment and that the overall circulation in their bodies is better because the toxins in their body have been removed and feel like their bodies have been cleaned,” she continues.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“The before and after photos are not as important as the inside benefits. … You will see results after the first time, but you need to continue the treatment for the best results. … Some people come to me before a vacation or a party, but that’s only for one massage and it’s not a quick fix. In Brazil, people do them all year round,” she reveals.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>To maintain your body’s tip-top shape and functionality, Lanini suggests clients come in to see her once a week, exercise in between, avoid sugary drinks and food and practice some self-care at home.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kendall-Jenner-Bikini-Pic-Slide.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“After a massage, try not to drink alcohol or juice and avoid sugar for at least three hours. If you can wait one day, that’s even better, but three hours is enough for your body to take off everything and stay clean. … Exercise makes a difference too and I recommend ones that are low impact like pilates, yoga and [P.volve] because they stretch your muscles and work well with the massages. Other than that, I tell my clients to massage their faces with their hands every day and night for five minutes when applying their creams,” she adds.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaamp%2BqwW6vxKWcm2WcpMOmsIyfo5qumZZ6ra3NoqWiq12hxq68x5qroptdmb%2Bitc2anp5lnZbAtK3Gnqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
