I would never tell or try to convince a young Black man or anyone period to crash out! I changed my life and started taking rapping serious because I knew that I wouldn’t make it if I kept doing what I was doing,” expressed.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>During his episode of </span><span>Off the Record</span><span>, Nardo took some time to really explain how much his childhood affected his choices as a teen. “When my mama first came home from prison, and as I got older, I started to realize that we’re really struggling,” he said. “I slept on the floor for like 3 years straight, that’s why I don’t care to have a bed.
