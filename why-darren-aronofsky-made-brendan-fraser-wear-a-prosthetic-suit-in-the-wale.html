Firstly, the actor was sexually assaulted by the then-president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, Phillip Berk.</p><p>And when he tried to talk about the abuse he endured, this Hollywood mogul used his influence to blacklist him. In addition to this, Fraser had to deal with <a href=# rel=nofollow>numerous health issues</a>, because many of his past roles had taken a massive toll on his body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>How Much Of Brendan Fraser's Net Worth Loses Has He Made Back In 2021?</a></span></p><p>Fortunately for Fraser and his fans, the actor has slowly made a comeback to Hollywood.

To play the lead character in The Whale, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Fraser wore a prosthetic suit</a> that added 50 to 300 pounds depending on the scene he was playing. In addition to this, the actor would spend up to six hours in the makeup chair every day in order to fully transform into the character.</p><p>Although there has been some criticism for casting Brendan Fraser for this role, as well as for having the actor wear prosthetics to give life to this character, the director of the movie, Darren Aronofsky, has repeatedly defended this choice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“There's no way you can cast someone to play this job, so we had to use makeup to get there. Most of the people that are playing critique have not seen the film. So I welcome everyone to see the film because the film is about bringing empathy to characters that you don't expect to feel for,” Aronofsky admitted (via <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cinema Blend</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdma6zvsSnZJqqn6O8p7%2FKsmSmmZSaeqO%2BxKebmqZdm7%2Biv8SrZLCdkad6onnPq6asrJiawaqvjKysoqxdnrtuwMeeZLCZnJp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
