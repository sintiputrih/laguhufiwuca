The Pokémon that normally looks like a Poké Ball’s evil twin more so resembles a ketchup-and-mayo stain than a perfectly shaped sphere, with its nebulous border and uneven eyes giving us longing for a more symmetrical rendition.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Dot Esports</a> writer Ryan Galloway, who made his own excellent list of terrible Pokémon cards that includes those that are useless in terms of their abilities in-game, put it best when he declared: “Maybe it’s for good reason that this art never made its way to any English set.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Nintendo Power Pikachu E3 Promo Card</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh3.googleusercontent.com/F4AEha9FjL0t9VqakUDxSf4plxvV2j3i3XBokIHLqSsq5KpjVRfNOaUw-V7BFee-yzlg5JTB0P5SPZ5A2FsFNHTbzwYeEralbLNmI5R-spLfOuPRQjjaXTvDTiaw8Qtyu02VgiMFSc-DFBzDgRADPQ><p data-characters=788 data-current-count=788 data-injectable=true>The Pikachu promo card that came free inside the mass-produced Nintendo Power magazine in 1999 can be considered a case of mistaken identity when it comes to greatly resembling a more valuable card on the market. The main difference is that the Nintendo Power version of the Pikachu card, featuring the character’s Gen I design, has yellow cheeks. Whereas much more valuable versions of the Pikachu card with red cheeks were distributed that same year, months earlier at E3. Other than that, the Pikachu card from Nintendo Power does represent a full reprint of the E3 card,&nbsp;including a gold E3 logo that can be seen on the lower-right corner of the artwork. However, the Pikachu card that came from Nintendo’s flagship magazine is worth little today, as <a href=#>Screen Rant</a> pointed out:</p><p>“Despite the TCG collectible featuring the popular Pikachu, the promo card can be picked up for $2 on sites like eBay in 2022.”</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>By comparison, the red cheek version of the Pikachu card, given out at the actual E3 convention in 1999, has a net worth of or above <a href=#>$800 for a used condition card on eBay</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Misdreavus (WoTC Promo)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh4.googleusercontent.com/YnSQAkkQbrNJStVdWO_VDq5ooWXUtB-FrzaIdLRtEehpxgr6xwJUSuAbyFuGEHbS1teNfekSCM30NjMhyRgmxtHyxpDtVWDL3S87Hyivuwdai_t0YjIFSKgSBPYJk0JffUWqvIXU029JM_XPX08xWg><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>Misdreavus is a Ghost-type Pokémon whose typical presentation resembling a bowling ball covered in a bedsheet is quite cute. However, something went seriously wrong with a Wizards of the Coast promo version of the Misdreavus card from 1999. Rather than the usual ball shape, the psychic creature has a skewed egg-like shape and sports a weird expression that does not do its usual puppy-dog-like eyes justice. Not only that, but the card is not very valuable on the collector’s market with it being available for less than $2 on <a href=#>TCGPlayer.com</a>.</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=153 data-injectable=false>“This Misdreavus looks like it sells propane and propane accessories,” one <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit user</a> remarked in a discussion about ugly Pokémon card art.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>“The way that the chin seems to extend so far from her face just compliments how funny this art is,” remarked TrainerSam on the blog site <a href=#>Amino</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Skuntank (Pokémon Rumble)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh3.googleusercontent.com/tJajhmEd2TgmFPJuHjfJ-LxYopaCjHXsjGBmNmi5ithOJAg9F-9z8TqpNCkKSoyRJNCZzD-R0CYnMTdJAyvzjiOSTFeJMj7lntDikCExEXPWFXuLZPqa_Q_2E_2BAafT_vU826qIofZTdWPHWyz5XA><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>Skuntank isn’t necessarily the most aesthetically pleasing Pokémon ever, however, the rendition from the&nbsp;Pokémon Rumble set is particularly baffling. The cards, which tie into a Nintendo Wii video game of the same name, were notoriously full of unappealing artwork (see: Gyarados), but Skuntank’s indiscernible mass of polygonal purple and white takes the cake.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>One <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit user</a>’s disgust sums up our own feelings on the card, “Oh my god WHY.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Brock’s Onix (Gym Heroes)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh6.googleusercontent.com/WfJYrHDpXiUcfd8XCFQGCzbVzfpaRQJVi63iFI6wXum7ASmC31Lr5ikEEINpsOIHcRBBLOBv1W8eroBTmVVg6xclSIRsO1KDO_bX6_SmwnrGtQMSibZWhqz_XFqELsomgfKNB7ktaAUOUbpUZuVLEA><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>Another card that boasts the double dishonor of looking goofy and having a low monetary value is Brock’s Onix from the Gym Heroes expansion.

You’d think a powerful rock serpent would be easy for artists to capture, but all too often he looks scared, tired or off-model. Those qualities are all present in the “Lost Thunder” card, which depicts the rock-type burrowing through the soil with a depressed and exhausted expression on its face.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>We know there are great Onix cards out there, but we also have to ask – does someone have a grudge against this particular Pokémon?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Pokémon The Movie 2000: The Power Of One Ancient Mew Promo (International Edition)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh4.googleusercontent.com/CVO-yPXKZSOWn-xwuoc2IiZ3H3ETbV7x2xLejNkhIGw5KEESGmFx0TFcaizhMtZn9JudJraZn968r_UITk_Quv32L2LFo-D3VfI6f0szRzJF4zECauVKEvqOPe2Ef-vpnjayBqzZmPxHQcyD9XZh7w><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=710 data-injectable=true>When Pokémon The Movie 2000 came out, it was a big deal to kids who were fans of the franchise’s video games, card game, and popular anime TV show. So, it’s only natural moviegoers would want to commemorate the occasion by picking up one of the holographic Pokémon cards, The Power Of One Ancient Mew Promo, when they were given away as part of the pre-order for movie tickets of Pokémon the Movie 2000.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false>Although it looks nice, the card is unfortunately not worth nearly as much as its Japanese-exclusive counterpart, but the international version still gets mistaken as such by fans to this day. As <a href=#>ScreenRant</a> pointed out:</p><p>“The worldwide release of Ancient Mew was over-produced and was printed with cheaper material.

One of the most notable gimmick cards is “_______’s Pikachu” (you’re supposed to write your own name on the card). This features the attack “Birthday Surprise”, which normally deals 30 damage. However, if it’s the player’s birthday on that day they can flip a coin. Heads adds on 50 more damage, and tails adds on 30 more damage.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>But though that’s a decent amount of damage, this isn’t what got it quickly banned in tournament play. Organizers quickly realized using this card would mean players would have the prove their date of birth during play, which would have slowed games down and forced judges to make calls on whether the ID is fake or not.</p><p data-characters=58 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>It’s creative, but also destined to cause arguments.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Brock’s Crobat (Theater Limited VS Pack – Japan)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh3.googleusercontent.com/W0sFeNjoTa6PIYGRuChrnI2x4d1aHD5-f4Wh5BVo8lRNzJITJTLS0l8UNEWK6V-NfIvN_QlWS9xLo4JbwI1d5y-ZXKd8niCRSK9iCH0RRWP0FYrZfAVdBZ5IHsWXxnw6O6aCgEN87vSRd4G6C1A0-A><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>Crobat sports an unusually buck-toothed grimace in the Brock’s Crobat card that was exclusive to Japan as part of the Theater Limited VS Pack, a promo release that tied in to the Pokémon TV show. The card was never officially released in the U.S., but it has nevertheless gained a reputation on the internet for its horrendous appearance.</p><p data-characters=110 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>“The look in his eyes mixed with those gigantic teeth just seem so off,” one <a href=#>blog writer</a> remarked.</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=160 data-injectable=false>One <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit user</a> said, as part of a greater discussion about ugly Pokémon cards, “WOW!

The card itself looks great and the rendering of Pikachu in the style of Van Gogh is full of personality and style. That said, the <a href=#>crazy drama surrounding this card</a> and the consequences of the promo force us to put it on the Worst Cards list.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>In a nutshell, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam severely underestimated the popularity of this limited edition card and chaos ensued, resulting in near-riots as fans turned up en masse to score a card. To add insult to injury, when the online distribution came around bots snatched almost all of them up instantly.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>That left a bad taste in fans’ mouths – though the employees of the Van Gogh Museum have had it worse. Recognizing the demand, four workers decided to game the system, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one accused of “embezzling” a box of the cards</a>. I will repeat that the card is fine, but it’s been at the centre of a true nightmare and must make this list.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Fake Pokémon cards</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Twenty boxes of counterfeit <a href=#>#Pokemon</a> <a href=#>#Pikachu</a> game cards weighing over 7.6 tons were intercepted at Shanghai's Pudong Airport by customs officials yesterday. Bound for the Netherlands from a company in Qingdao province, it is one of the biggest fake <a href=#>#IP</a> hauls in recent years. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zM2y6BiTIt</a></p>— Yicai 第一财经 (@yicaichina) <a href=#>November 23, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>Few things in life compare to the utter helplessness one feels after being scammed. You buy a thing, being told that it’s a genuine article, only to find out later that it is a counterfeit. That’s exactly what has happened to casual players and hardcore collectors alike when it comes to Pokémon cards.</p><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=817 data-injectable=true>One of the biggest hauls of a counterfeit operation in recent memory was when 7.6 tons of fake Pokémon cards were seized last fall at Pudong Airport in Shanghai, in a shipment originally bound for the Netherlands, according to Yicai Global, a China state-affiliated media outlet. This all occurred during the pandemic, following the Pokémon card game’s surge in popularity, with The Pokémon Company selling a staggering 3.7 billion cards during the 2020-2021 fiscal year, according to <a href=#>Nintendo Life</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>The only semblance of pleasure fake cards seem to provide is the schadenfreude we experience when someone detestable gets scammed. Case in point, YouTuber Logan Paul said he lost $3.5 million on fake Pokémon cards, as <a href=#>IGN</a> reported. Maybe that’s how the cosmic karma scales balance for a social media personality who would later announce he is turning the world’s most expensive Pokémon card — the Pikachu Illustrator, which he owns — into a blockchain-backed digital collectable known as an NFT, as <a href=#>We Got This Covered</a> previously reported.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Pokémon cards that are too perfect</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh3.googleusercontent.com/X-lamg1JZRD6hpWJqlZLL6A1UbFxv-yG5gCeDYsWsjshbOd1Psmj-Ath2HZZBjl-Db3yZbjyo6VepTBa_1l6cEAR2L0ljDP-9HLEv68MnHNF4BNjWOBC8rXb0lqKLgQe-JIW9D_t55rLnX4Fg4TPNw><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>Perhaps the only loss that seems like a crueler twist of fate than being the victim of a counterfeit Pokémon card purchase is missing out on a fortune because you own a plain ol’ version of a card, rather than its more coveted version that contains a rare and valuable manufacturing error, such as a misspelling, miscut, or even a blank card, as <a href=#>The Gamer</a> listed out.</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>For instance, if you own a plain old Blastoise card, it could run you anywhere between $5 or into the thousands, depending on the specific type and condition, according to <a href=#>Sellpoke.com</a>. However, a Blastoise with a Magic the Gathering backing to it is considered much more valuable and could be worth north of a quarter of a million dollars.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>Such a card, which was one of the first Pokémon cards ever printed as a prototypical run by manufacturer Wizards of the Coast, was sold at <a href=#>Heritage Auctions</a> last year for a tidy sum of $324,000.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>Only a few of the Magic the Gathering Pokémon cards — which were printed in 1998 — have been officially certified as genuine, according to The Gamer, and they are all Blastoise.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoq6GdXWZ9bsPOq6qtZaCkuKa5zqdknJmimcBuu8VmmKWkXam2rrGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
