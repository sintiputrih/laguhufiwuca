The pair may have decided to go their separate ways; however, they still share a pure relationship.</p><p class=Zg>This was confirmed recently after Shaunie discussed the topic of their relationship on the show, "Tamron Hall" During the interview which happened virtually, the famous TV personality revealed to host Tamron Hall that she and Shaq <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/sports/shaquille-oneals-ex-wife-shaunie-jokes-she-pushes-him-to-get-a-girlfriend-so-he-stops-bugging-her/>support themselves all the time</a>.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Shaunie O'Neal attends the grand opening of Shaquille's at L.A. in Los Angeles, California in March 2020 | Photo: Getty Images.</p><p class=Zg>Shaunie even confessed that she often urges him to get a woman so he can stop "randomly FaceTiming" her to tell her about his day. She also revealed Shaq's desire to have more kids in addition to the six he already has.</p><p class=Zg>Of the six, one is Shaunie's son from a previous relationship, and another is the product of his relationship with his ex, Arnette Yarborough. Shaunie thinks he has "pushed over that hill" but is not trying to discourage his ambition. She <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ddgIpdpXs4">added,</a></p><p class=Zg>"But whatever it is, that's his business.

There is no doubt about this— they excel so much at co-parenting that Shaunie decided to have him join her in writing a book about it.</p><p class=Zg>The book was initially meant to center around her life after their divorce; however, she thought he could make contributions, and it quickly <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.vh1.com/news/330298/shaunie-writes-book-with-shaq/>became about co-parenting</a> after a divorce.</p><p class=Zg>Shaunie and the legendary NBA star started their relationship in 1998. They were together for four years before they finally <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/is-shaq-married>tied the knot</a> in 2002.</p><p class=Zg>A couple of years into the marriage, trouble was recorded in paradise, and the pair separated. They got back together briefly but could not make their marriage work and finally divorced in 2009.</p><p class=Zg>Since their divorce, the former NBA player has dated a couple of other women, including reality TV star Nicole Alexander and actress Annie Ilonzeh. Like <a class="zd d" href=#>Shaunie</a>, fans hope Shaq finds someone— and soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtsbm9pZnq0tMCqrKKknJp6sLrEmqOsZZWteri1xZ5krKCRqruqsYysmLKrXai1b7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
