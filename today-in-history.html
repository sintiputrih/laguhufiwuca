A Native American leader and warrior from the area that would become Ohio, Tecumseh resisted the expansion of white American settlers throughout the entirety of his storied life. He founded a confederacy of tribes and allied with the British to fight American expansion, but he ultimately died during that fateful clash during the War of 1812.</p><h2>1892: The Dalton Gang Is Wiped Out</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-384274 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/today-in-history-october-5.jpeg alt="Today In History Dalton Gang" width=900 height=674 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-384274 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>Deceased members of the Dalton gang following their failed bank robberies.</span></p><p>Most members of the Dalton Gang are killed after two failed bank robberies in Coffeyville, Kansas. Some of the most infamous Wild West outlaws in American history, the members of the gang attempted to rob the First National Bank and Condon Bank right in the middle of the day.</p><p>But the townspeople fought back, killing every member of the gang except Emmett Dalton, who was sent to prison before playing himself in a movie version of his gang’s story following his release.</p><h2>1974: Dave Kunst Completes His Walk Around The World</h2><p>Dave Kunst becomes the first verified person in history to circumnavigate the globe on foot. About four years earlier, he and his brother John left Waseca, Minnesota, and started walking east. They walked around the world — John was killed by bandits in Afghanistan in 1972 — and Dave returned to Waseca in 1974.</p><h2>2003: Timothy Treadwell, The “Grizzly Man,” And His Girlfriend Are Fatally Attacked By A Bear</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Timothy Treadwell</a> and his girlfriend <a href=# rel=noopener>Amie Huguenard</a> are fatally attacked by a bear in Katmai National Park, Alaska. Treadwell made a name for himself as a bear enthusiast. Treadwell would frequently travel to Alaska to film documentaries about brown bears and protect the animals from poachers.</p><p>On an October trip to Katmai, Treadwell and Huguenard set up camp in the hopes of finding Treadwell’s favorite female bear. An air taxi pilot would spot the couple’s mangled remains a day later. A video tape at the scene recorded audio of the couple being torn apart by a hungry bear looking to bulk up for the hibernation season.</p><h2>2011: Steve Jobs Dies</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-384275 alt="Steve Jobs" width=900 height=617 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/steve-jobs-2006.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-384275 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Many thought Steve Jobs looked gaunt in 2006, though an Apple spokesperson insisted his health was “robust.”</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Steve Jobs dies</a> at the age of 56 following a battle with pancreatic cancer.</p><p>The co-founder of Apple, Jobs helped develop revolutionary technologies like the iMac, iPod, and iPhone. However, after first getting his cancer diagnosis in 2003, Jobs delayed getting crucial surgery which might have saved his life, in favor of alternative medicine.
