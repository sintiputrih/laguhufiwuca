Celebrities get most of their information about what past partners are up to from the paparazzi and press. In the age of celebrity, fans and foes alike can scroll Instagram to find out who their ex is canoodling with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regular folk often avoid their exes like the plague, while celebrities are often asked to share their feelings about past romantic partners during interviews. Stars are often surprised with information about who their ex is dating, engaged to, and more. Once children are involved, most celebs and non-famous folk try to keep things amicable for the sake of the kids.</p><p>While Hollywood has brought us tons of romance as of late, with many couples coming together, breakups and divorces are also in the mix. It’s estimated that 40 to 50 percent of American marriages end in divorce, so common sense dictates that celebrity relationships don't always last. These relationships are just a lot more public. Sometimes, they are a lot messier, too, since there's typically oodles of cash to go to court over.</p><p>Marriage is tough work for everyone - add in the pressures of fame and grueling filming and travel requirements, and things get even more difficult.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, we're going to share updates on the careers, lives, and romantic interests of these 13 recently divorced couples.</p><h2 id=adele-and-simon-konecki><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Adele And Simon Konecki</span></h2><p>Some of Adele’s best music has been inspired by lost love. After she announced the end of her relationship with Simon Konecki, everyone was wondering what was next, especially since it looked like the singer had retired.</p><p>Multiple sources close to the singer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People Magazine</a>, “She talks about last year as a very difficult year, and she’s said in the past that creating new music is almost like therapy. You can tell that she is ready to share with her fans.”</p><p>Others can’t stop talking about Adele being spotted on a beach vacation with Harry Styles. James Corden was also on this vacation, but people are sensing the love connection between Styles and Adele.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=solange-knowles-and-alan-ferguson><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Solange Knowles And Alan Ferguson</span></h2><p>Work has been a focus for Solange Knowles since her recent divorce from Alan Ferguson. Solange, who was married and divorced (and the mother of a child) by the time she was 21 (and married and divorced again by 27) says she’s learned a lot, post-marriage number two.</p><p>Solange has started her own record label and she's the Creative Director of Puma. She said, "Everyone talks about how, in your 30s, all of these growing pains transition into wisdom and you feel more self-assured and confident. But I think I had a bit of a jump-start on that at 27."</p><h2 id=bradley-cooper-and-irina-shayk><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Bradley Cooper And Irina Shayk</span></h2><p>Since his split from Irina Shayk, Bradley Cooper has spent most of his time working and focusing on raising his daughter. Brad and Irina weren't legally married, but they were a long-term couple who are well worth a mention here.</p><p>Cooper said, “I guess having a child, and having a family of my own—which is a miracle and something I've always dreamt of—has opened me up even more, I guess, to the day, and to be present."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Cooper has said that he’s not dating yet, Shayk was spotted in New York City with a ‘mystery man’ just weeks after her relationship with Bradley ended.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Miley Cyrus And Liam Hemsworth</span></h2><p>After over a decade of on-and-off romance, and a marriage that lasted less than a year, both Miley and Liam have moved on. Liam has a movie in post-production and was recently spotted introducing his family to his model girlfriend, Gabriella Brooks. That happened this past December.</p><p>While Hemsworth has been low-key about his relationship with the Australian model, people are speculating that things are serious. Miley has been more public about her post-divorce relationships and is currently romantically connected to Cody Simpson, although there have been recent rumors of a breakup.</p><p>Miley is currently working on a short film, Fly On The Wall,&nbsp;that is in pre-production.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sara-gilbert-and-linda-perry><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Sara Gilbert And Linda Perry</span></h2><p>After nearly six years as a married couple, Gilbert and Perry separated this winter. The two are working together to co-parent their 5-year old son, Rhodes, and Gilbert’s two kids from a previous marriage, Levi Hank and Sawyer Jane.</p><p>The divorce comes shortly after Gilbert stepped back from some of her hosting work on The Talk&nbsp;in order to focus on her family.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga-and-christian-carino><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lady Gaga And Christian Carino</span></h2><p>While Gaga and her ex, Christian Carino, were engaged, rather than married, their split still rocked the headlines. For the first time since they called off the wedding, Gaga got real with the audience during a Las Vegas residency show.</p><p>Before performing “Someone to Watch Over Me”, the singer lamented that the last time she sang the song, she had a ring on her finger. She showed her fans her ringless finger.</p><p>Just a few days ago (in Feb. 2020), Gaga announced that she’s dating someone new, and he is a tech investor named Michael Polansky.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=colin-firth-and-livia-giuggioli><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Colin Firth And Livia&nbsp;Giuggioli</span></h2><p>After 22 years of marriage, Colin Firth and Livia&nbsp;Giuggioli decided to throw in the towel. While the split is amicable, as the two continue to co-parent their children, people weren’t all that surprised that their marriage didn't last.</p><p>In 2018, Colin and Livia, who have generally been notoriously private about their relationship, revealed that Livia had an extramarital affair with an Italian journalist while the two were separated.</p><p>A source close to them said, “Things never really came around for them (after that). No matter what was decided when they stayed together after her affair, nothing could erase that betrayal. It was time to move on, even though they had a solid family relationship and really wanted to save it.”</p><p>Colin is currently focused on work, filming a movie called&nbsp;Operation Mincemeat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-hendricks-and-geoffrey-arend><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Christina Hendricks And Geoffrey Arend</span></h2><p>After 10 years of marriage, Hendricks and Arend announced their split in a joint statement on Instagram, saying, “Twelve years ago we fell in love and became partners. We joined our two amazing families, had countless laughs, made wonderful friends and were blessed with incredible opportunities. Today we take our next step together, but on separate paths. We will always be grateful for the love we’ve shared and will always work together to raise our two beautiful dogs.”</p><p>Hendricks is gearing up for the release of season three of her show,&nbsp;Good Girls, while Arend has just wrapped his work on the TV Series,&nbsp;Madam Secretary.</p><h2 id=ian-ziering-and-erin-ludwig><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ian Ziering And Erin Ludwig</span></h2><p>This fall, Ian Ziering announced his separation from centerfold wife, Erin Ludwig, after nine years of marriage. The split has been amicable and Ziering was quick to dismiss claims to the contrary.</p><p>Ziering said, “It has come to my attention that things are being written and said to sensationalize a situation that is simply not sensational. Any quote attributed to me is completely false and solely meant by haters to undermine our intention to continue to get along, protect and raise our daughters, and be examples of successful co-parents.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No projects are currently listed for Ziering in the immediate future, following the 90210 re-boot.</p><h2 id=jillian-michaels-and-heidi-rhoades><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jillian Michaels And Heidi Rhoades</span></h2><p>Everyone’s favorite body shamer, Jillian Michaels, has announced her split from long-time partner and co-parent, Heidi Rhoades. After spending nine years together, things have ended and the two work on co-parenting their two children.</p><p>Michaels has been romantically connected to a new girlfriend, Deshanna Marie Minuto, since late 2018, which was shortly after the split. Jillian is preparing to launch her own athletic line and is currently writing a book, which will be published in 2021.</p><h2 id=tom-arnold-and-ashley-groussman><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tom Arnold And Ashley Groussman</span></h2><p>Tom Arnold must be easy to love and difficult to live with, since his recent split from wife, Ashley Groussman, marks the end of his fourth marriage. These two were together for nearly 10 years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a statement about their split, which was reported on ET Online, Arnold said, “For the last couple of years we grew apart and have been moving in different directions, which is why at this time we have decided to end our marriage. I told Ashley that it's her life, we had great years together and there doesn't have to be a reason or a bad guy to move on. Go live your life, you owe me nothing."</p><p>Arnold has recently become politically active and is very vocal about his dislike of a certain US figurehead.</p><h2 id=jeff-and-mackenzie-bezos><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jeff And Mackenzie Bezos</span></h2><p>One of the most famous recent splits is the breakup of Amazon Founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, and his wife, Mackenzie. They were together for 25 years.</p><p>Post-divorce, novelist Mackenzie has turned her efforts to charity, saying, “In addition to whatever assets life has nurtured in me, I have a disproportionate amount of money to share. My approach to philanthropy will continue to be thoughtful. It will take time and effort and care. But I won't wait. And I will keep at it until the safe is empty."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Mackenzie isn’t dating, Jeff is romantically linked to TV anchor, Lauren Sanchez.</p><h2 id=jennifer-garner-and-ben-affleck><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jennifer Garner And Ben Affleck</span></h2><p>After what seemed like one of the longest divorces in Hollywood, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have finally moved on. The two work hard to co-parent their children and remain friendly. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Weekly</a> reports that Jen’s new boyfriend has been a positive influence on Ben, saying, “Jen having a boyfriend has been the best thing to happen to Ben and Jen in a long time. Ben’s become a better parent.”</p><p>Many think that Jen and boyfriend, John Miller, will be engaged soon, and Ben will be supportive of the engagement. Garner recently appeared in the film,&nbsp;Peppermint, while Affleck is focusing his efforts on producing.</p><p>Sources: Business Insider, Hollywood Reporter, Refinery 29, Stylecaster, Harper's Bazaar</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8 Photos Of 90 Day Fiance Couples Who Filed For Divorce (12 Surprisingly Still Together)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp2WlpbGiwMRmpqdlpJ2ytLGMampmqpWYsq%2FAy7JknaGmpL%2BkscNmmp6klZe%2FqsDYZpqoraChsrR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
