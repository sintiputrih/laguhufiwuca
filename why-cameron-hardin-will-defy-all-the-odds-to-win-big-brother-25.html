How sweet is that?</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>Avoiding eviction after eviction, Cameron is playing Big Brother as hard as he can, and he is willing to do anything it takes to make sure he will take home the victory, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we all remember him backstabbing his number one ally earlier this season</a>, do we not?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cameron-hardin.png><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>Second of all, Cameron has proven himself to be a competition beast, winning two Head of Household competitions, one Power of Veto competition, and coming close on numerous other occasions.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>Given his track record, should Cameron reenter the Big Brother house, he will likely take home another Head of Household win. He has proven time and time again he is not afraid to go after some huge threats, so who do you think the Georgia native would target during his HoH reign?</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false>Cameron has proven numerous times that he is truly playing the game for himself, and we don’t fault him for that whatsoever — in fact, we admire it!</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>In addition to this, Cameron would be reentering the game in a great position due to his alliance with with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jag Bains</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt Klotz</a> called “The Fugitives” (if that is real, of course).</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>With his “The Chillers” alliance member, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Utley</a>, out of the house, as well as staying neutral in regards to the feud between <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cory Wurtenberger</a> and Jared Fields, Cameron could easily coast his way to the top, using his relationships with Jag and Matt — we will just have to wait and see what happens!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4-2.png><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>Last, but certainly not least, if Cameron were to make it to the finale of Big Brother 25, he could have a win similar to that of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Underwood on Survivor: Edge of Extinction</a>.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Underwood</a>&nbsp;is one of the most controversial winners in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivor</a>&nbsp;history, spending 26 days on the Edge of Extinction, winning his way back into the competition on day 35, and still taking home $1 million and the title of “Sole Survivor” in the end. After getting eliminated on day 9, how did he manage to pull off the victory?</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=786 data-injectable=true>As soon as Chris won the challenge to return to the game, he hit the ground running, winning the&nbsp;final immunity challenge, but risking his safety to compete in one of the most infamous final four fire-making challenges of all time. In an extremely risky move, the South Carolina native made fire against <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rick Devens</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the best players the franchise has ever seen</a>, ultimately knocking out the frontrunner of the season.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>Given the game-changing moves that he made in such a short period of time, Chris was still seen as a better competitor than runner-ups Gavin Whitson and Julie Rosenberg, causing him to be awarded the title of “Sole Survivor” in a 9-4-0 vote.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>If Cameron wins the competition on Thursday (September 28), he could have a very similar journey to that of Chris Underwood — he will undoubtedly return to the game stronger than ever before!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Big-Brother-Cameron-Hardin-Jared-Fields-Zombies.png><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>While we are confident that if Cameron stays he will take home the $750,000 cash prize, this Thursday’s episode of Big Brother&nbsp;will determine whether or not he will be walking out the door for good.</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>Although last night’s episode left fans on a cliffhanger, chatter on the Big Brother live feeds implies that Cameron won the Resurrection Rumble competition, ultimately leaving him with one major decision.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>With a challenge on the horizon that determines their fate in the game, Cameron can either decide to play himself or choose for Jared to play. If the competing houseguest wins, then they will reenter the Big Brother house once and for all. On the other hand, if the competing houseguest loses, then the other zombie will get their game resurrected — the stakes are at an all time high!</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>Find out which zombie stays in the Big Brother house on Thursday, September 28, at 9pm ET/PT on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tNhmmpqllae8r3nHmqmdoZ5ixKq4y2abnp6pYq6tuIytn55ln5mxtHnTqGSwoZ5ir6qzjJupqKyYmr9ufpRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
