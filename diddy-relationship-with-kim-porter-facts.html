Porter, a former model and actress, died from lobar pneumonia in 2018.</p><p>Since her passing, Diddy hasn’t been shy to talk about the pain he endured in the wake of losing someone he considered “more than soulmates”, saying <strong>they were “more than best friends.”</strong> Though the two ended their romantic relationship, they stayed in each other’s lives as friends and devoted parents.</p><p>Diddy was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the 2022 Bet Awards where he performed “I’ll Be Missing You” in honor of Kim. In addition to telling the audience "I miss Kim", he also gave a shout-out to Notorious B.I.G, about whom the song was written after his 1997 passing. His emotional tribute had viewers wondering <strong>what their thirteen-year relationship was like</strong> when <a href=#>they dated from the '90s to the 2000s</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/diddy-combs-superbowl.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Why Legal Expert Thinks Diddy Combs Could Go To Prison For The Rest Of His Life</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>A legal expert spoke about the case and shared insight into what the future might look like for Diddy if the charges were brought against him.</span><p><strong>Updated April 2024:</strong>Sean Combs is the center of a federal investigation.
