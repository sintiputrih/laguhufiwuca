Super Bowl LVIII is just around the corner and Friends fans should keep an eye out when the game goes on a (commercial) break. Uber Eats debuted one of their ads, which stars a myriad of celebs, on TODAY ahead of Sunday's game. It opens up on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Aniston</a> receiving an Uber Eats order on set from a crew member who remarks that she didn't realize you could order things like flowers on Uber Eats, saying she'll have to remember that in the future. Aniston goes on to say that she's had to "make a little room" in her brain to recall Uber Eats's services.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Well, you know what they say," she quips. "In order to remember something, you gotta forget something else."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aniston's Friends co-star David Schwimmer (who played the Ross to Aniston's Rachel) then runs into her on set and leans in to give his pal a hug — that is until Aniston rejects his gesture. "Have we met?"&nbsp;she asks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Give me a hint," she says. "We worked together for 10 years,"&nbsp;Schwimmer reminds her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Ten years?" Aniston exclaims. "You were great!"</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While she walks away from her former colleague she mutters under her breath, "Like I'd forget 10 years of my life." The camera pans back to Schwimmer who says, "I hate this town."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Victoria and David Beckham also make an appearance in the ad after the company revealed a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>separate spot that spoofs their "be honest" moment</a> from David's Netflix docu-series Beckham. In this video, the two appear to forget the name of Victoria's iconic girl group band The Spice Girls. "Remember when you used to be a pepper lady?" David asks while holding up a spice shaker. "Wasn't it the Cinnamon Sisters?" Posh questions before the two go back and forth with cheeky iterations of the name. "Basil Babes?" "Paprika Girls?" "No, that's absurd," David says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Country singer and Best New Artist nominee at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sunday's Grammys</a> Jelly Roll also stars in the spot, forgetting he has face tattoos. At the very end of the ad, Super Bowl Halftime performer Usher can be seen backstage with his Uber Eats order. "I hope I get to play a halftime show someday, man," he says, much to the surprise of his team members standing next to him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Friends stars and on-screen love interests sparked dating rumors after the Friends: Reunion special when they revealed that they had mutual crushes on each other while filming the first season. Fans hoped for a present-day romance, however, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aniston shut down those rumors</a> during an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Entertainment Tonight</a> interview. "That was bizarre. Like, really? That's my brother," she said of Schwimmer. "But I understand it, though. It just shows you how hopeful people are for fantasies for dreams to come true."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yZ6lp6GWmr9urc2iqq2nnmKxosLInWSsm5istq65xKtkn6qZmrulv4yumZ6qXZqutb%2BMrKypnaJir7DDy2aaqKWdmr%2BktcClZHFtZW6Bcn4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
