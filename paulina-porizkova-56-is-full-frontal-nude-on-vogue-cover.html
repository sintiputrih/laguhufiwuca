Full frontal nude, at 56, on Vogue CZ. I’d really like to thank the brave folks at Vogue CZ <span class=s1>(editor-in-chief&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=s2>@andreabehounkova</span></a>&nbsp;and creative director&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=s2>@kralicek</span></a>) for daring to do this – but most of all the incredible team behind this photo shoot,” she captioned the photo.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s3>“I can’t wait to share the inside pages as well, this was one of the most fun and playful photos shoots I have done — possibly in my life. For you peeps who have a problem with the lack of coverup — you can peruse the pages fully dressed,” she continued, adding #betweenjloandbettywhite #sexyhasnoexpirationdate #40yearslater.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s3>Her post attracted rounds of applause from famous friends in just under an hour, with <a href=#><strong>Lisa Rinna</strong></a> dropping a series of clapping emojis, <a href=#><strong>Elle Macpherson</strong></a> writing, “Love,” and <strong>Miss J Alexander</strong> chiming in with a resounding, “Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssss.”</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s3>Others were made sure to call out Porizkova’s confidence. For example, <strong>Amanda Caroline Cronin</strong> wrote, “Celebrating women over 50 always a great idea bravo for getting almost naked and showing how fabulous you can be in mid life !!! Breaking molds & stereo types championing & pioneering, guiding & inspiring !!! Love it, pure class.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/See-Paulina-Porizkova-56-Go-Full-Frontal-Nude-On-Vogue-CS-Cover-Promo.jpg><p class=p4><span class=s3>While Porizkova went “full frontal naked” for her most recent cover, it’s not the first time the model has stripped down for a picture. In 2021, she’s posted a handful of lingerie-clad photos to Instagram.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p4><span class=s3>That said, the model has received a fair amount of “backlash” in response to her risqué posts. “In my 20s, I was celebrated for showing up in lingerie. I was getting a lot of money for it and everybody loved me,” Porizkova said during the April 2, episode of The Tamron Hall Show.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s3>She continued: “In my 50s, I still think I look pretty good in lingerie, but the reaction is reviled, obviously not by everybody … there’s a fair amount of backlash.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6WutrjIp5hmqJ%2Bntru3zq%2BYZm1mYra0ecWuo6Vllqe8r8DApWSnrZSaerC6jK%2BmoK2VYrCwwsSrZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
