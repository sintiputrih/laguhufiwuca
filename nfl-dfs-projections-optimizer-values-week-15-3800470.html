We again have a lot of movement at QB this week with taking over for <span class=caps>ATL</span>, taking over for the injured Murray, starting for the injured White, and potentially and starting if either Pickett or Wilson end up out in concussion protocol. The Texans will likely continue to use both Mills and Driskel at QB making this Houston offense even harder to trust, as is now out, and they could remain without Cooks and Collins at WR. The Patriots RBs and Bengals WRs will be interesting groups to monitor this week, as injuries to Stevenson, Harris, Higgins, and Boyd could provide more opportunity to guys like and who both found the end zone last week.</p><p>This is a weekly <span class=caps>NFL</span> article that can hopefully show you some lineup-building tools on RG as well as provide some picks and analysis based on those tools.</p><h2><strong>This Week’s FanDuel & DraftKings <span class=caps>NFL</span> <span class=caps>DFS</span> Projections Preview</strong></h2><p>There are ways to get edges in <span class=caps>DFS</span> <span class=caps>NFL</span>, such as stacking a WR or TE with your QB, correlating a RB or WR on the opposing team of your stack, and targeting volume guys with high floors who get goal-line carries and/or endzone targets that can maximize their ceilings with TDs. I will be focusing on the <strong>“main slate”</strong> for the week, but you can still find plenty of analysis for the Thursday and Monday <span class=caps>NFL</span> games on RG, and feel free to leave suggestions in the comments sections for any strategies/tools you’d like to see here!</p><p>This article is meant to highlight some of RG’s most helpful tools for <span class=caps>NFL</span>, including our industry-leading <a href=#><span class=caps>NFL</span> <span class=caps>DFS</span> projections</a> and <a href=#><span class=caps>NFL</span> lineup optimizer</a>, with some picks and analysis along the way. Let’s get to it!</p><h3><strong><span class=caps>NFL</span> <span class=caps>DFS</span> Injury Roundup</strong></h3><p>Before we take a look at the projected lineups and picks for the week, it’s important to get a feel for any injuries that we’ll need to monitor as the week goes on and how these injuries will affect our builds if a questionable player ends up out. For cash games, I’m looking for safety, volume, and upside. I tend to avoid players who are dealing with an injury, as they are more likely to aggravate it or possibly have their snaps limited compared to someone coming into the week fully healthy with a full week of practice under their belts.</p><p>Looking at <a href=#>The Situation Room</a> we can see who is still out for Week 134, how likely guys who missed week 13 are going to play in Week 14, and any new injuries that we’ll need to monitor ahead of Sunday and how it will affect lineups if certain questionable players end up sitting.</p><p>Important guys on the main slate who are out for Week 15 include , , , , , , , <a href=# class=player-popup id=courtland-sutton>Courtland Sutton</a>, , , <a href=# class=player-popup id=brandin-cooks>Brandin Cooks</a>, , , , , , , , , , , and .</p><p>is questionable and is doubtful.</p><p>and we’re activated off IR.</p><h3><strong><span class=caps>NFL</span> Projected Lineups – Analysis & Top Stacks</strong></h3><p>Let’s take a look at <a href=#><span class=caps>NFL</span> Starting Lineups</a> to see any major lineup news, such as guys missing or interesting depth chart changes <strong>(main slate for this article)</strong> as well as which teams or games I’m looking to stack. This page is my favorite tool for <span class=caps>NFL</span> <span class=caps>DFS</span> as we get betting lines, <span class=caps>DFS</span> salaries, projected ownership, and updated depth charts that we can refer to as we build our lineups or see what is affected by any news throughout the week. Make sure to take advantage of this page to keep you up to date on a variety of beneficial <span class=caps>DFS</span> info.</p><ul><li>will start for <span class=caps>ATL</span>, which should be an upgrade to the passing game, so a Ridder-London stack makes for a cheap <span class=caps>GPP</span> play with solid upside this week.</li></ul><ul><li>will start for the Jets as wasn’t cleared for contact with his ribs injury, so this is a downgrade for and the passing game overall, while still remains a strong play against <span class=caps>DET</span>.</li></ul><ul><li>and could start if Pickett or Wilson don’t clear the concussion protocol, so <span class=caps>PIT</span> and <span class=caps>DEN</span> could struggle even more to move the ball this week.</li></ul><ul><li>will start for <span class=caps>ARI</span> in a tough road matchup in Denver, so I’d be hesitant to use anyone outside of Conner or Hopkins for the Cardinals in <span class=caps>DFS</span> this week.</li></ul><ul><li>With out for Houston, we should see a timeshare between Ogunbowale and Burkhead and possibly Freeman as well if he’s elevated from the practice squad. & are expected to split the QB work again, so overall this offense is unpredictable and should have trouble moving the ball against KC without their top RB and possibly top WRs again.</li></ul><ul><li>We’ll see if Stevenson, Harris, or Meyers are able to play for the Patriots, but if the top two RBs sit, then would be the likely RB1 while could be the WR1 if Meyers is out, as Parker is in concussion protocol.</li></ul><ul><li>is looking at another huge target share if Higgins and/or Boyd are unable to play this week, while could be an interesting value play if he ends up as the WR2 or 3 for Cincy.</li></ul><ul><li>My favorite game stack is <span class=caps>TEN</span>/LAC, as I’d expect both teams to move the ball fairly easily against each other especially the Chargers passing game and Titans running game, so there should be plenty of red zone chances for both teams compared to a lot of the other games with low totals.</li></ul><h3><strong><span class=caps>NFL</span> DraftKings & FanDuel Lineup Optimizer Picks</strong></h3><p>With a good feel for injuries, projected lineups, and strong stacks to consider, let’s check out <a href=#>LineupHQ</a>, where you can create lineups in seconds with our lineup optimizer tool as well as the “build” tool where you can create up to 300 lineups at once based on your custom settings.</p><p>If we click on the “P/$” column header in the LineupHQ grid, it will rank all the available players from high to low based on their expected fantasy points per dollar of salary on the specific <span class=caps>DFS</span> site you have selected — this is one of the best starting points for finding value on any slate.</p><p>On <a href=#>FanDuel</a>:</p><ul><li>At QB, I’m jamming in ($9,000) and then figuring out the rest, as no one has the floor/ceiling combo that he does on the main slate. With three straight games over 29 FP, he could blow away the QB position again this week, and I don’t want to be someone hoping he doesn’t go off and then struggling to catch up with any other QB if he does go off. ($9,100) is someone that could also go bonkers against <span class=caps>HOU</span>, but there is too much risk that they just run the ball a ton or blow <span class=caps>HOU</span> out early, so I’d rather have a guy like Hurts facing a Bears team that is more likely to keep the game competitive.</li></ul><ul><li>($6,500) is an interesting <span class=caps>GPP</span> play, and I also like ($8,000), ($8,300), ($7,400), and ($6,900) for <span class=caps>GPP</span>s.</li></ul><ul><li>At RB, I’m liking the value of ($6,800) and ($7,200), as Montgomery is a nice correlation play with Hurts and Knight has an excellent matchup with <span class=caps>DET</span> and should remain the top RB for the Jets after seeing 19 touches with Carter active last week. <a href=# class=player-popup id=miles-sanders>Miles Sanders</a> ($7,800) is also a bit too cheap for how good he’s been over the last three weeks, and I don’t mind stacking him with Hurts and just getting all the Philly points. ($7,600) draws a nice matchup with <span class=caps>ATL</span> and is one of my favorite RBs for <span class=caps>GPP</span>s along with ($7,000), ($7,200), and ($7,600).</li></ul><ul><li>At WR, I like stacking ($8,200) with Hurts, as he’s still a bit too cheap given his huge upside, and I will also do my best to fit in ($9,000), as he has the highest ceiling at WR this week against a Bucs D that is worse against the pass, and Higgins/Boyd/Hurst aren’t 100%. ($7,000) is a nice correlation play with Chase, and if Godwin can find the end zone again, he could crush that salary, as he’s still seeing a ton of targets and is the cheapest he’s been since week 12. ($6,900) is the cheapest he’s been all season and is also in play if you prefer more deep ball opportunities compared to Godwin, and I think Evans breaks his TD drought this week. ($6,300) remains a great value play even against Dallas, as the Jags will likely have to throw a lot this game, and Jones is averaging over 10 targets in his last four games and looks like the WR1 for Lawrence.</li></ul><ul><li>At TE, I like going cheap with either ($5,600), ($5,800), ($5,100), or ($5,500). ($5,300) is also in play along with ($5,100) & ($6,000) if they come off IR.</li></ul><ul><li>My favorite defense this week is the Broncos ($3,700) at home against McCoy while the Panthers ($4,200) are another D I like at home against the struggling Steelers.</li></ul><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s3.amazonaws.com/rical-images/zonovan-knight-800x480.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Looking at <a href=#>DraftKings</a>:</p><ul><li>With ruled out this week, I’m really not loving any cheap QBs for cash games, so I will stick with ($8,200) and go cheap at some other positions . ($5,200) remains a favorite <span class=caps>GPP</span> QB along with ($5,300), ($7,200), ($6,200), ($6,000), and ($7,000).</li></ul><ul><li>At RB, I still really like the prices of ($6,300), ($5,300) and <a href=# class=player-popup id=miles-sanders>Miles Sanders</a> ($6,500) and don’t mind using all three in cash games. ($6,000), ($6,800), and ($5,900) are my favorite <span class=caps>GPP</span> RBs.</li></ul><ul><li>At WR, ($6,000) is still super cheap, and even with throwing him the ball now, he’s still in play for cash games, especially with the nice matchup with <span class=caps>DET</span>. ($4,900) is also still too cheap for someone seeing 10+ targets a game in a matchup where Jacksonville should have to throw more than run. I also really like ($3,400) for extreme value, as he saw 10 targets last game with Meyers out and Parker leaving early and draws a nice matchup with the Raiders and should be the WR1 or 2 if Meyers and/or Parker end up out. ($4,700) is another cheap WR to consider for cash games, as he should see 10+ targets from Ridder, as they saw plenty of work together in the preseason. ($6,700) and ($6,200) remain solid mid-range targets for correlation if you end up with Bengals exposure in cash games. With Sutton and Hinton out for <span class=caps>DEN</span>, I think ($6,100) is too cheap on DK and should be in serious consideration for your cash game lineup even with Rypien at QB.</li></ul><ul><li>At TE, we’re loaded with cheap options again, starting with ($3,600) in a great matchup with <span class=caps>ARI</span> and also ($3,100), who only went up $400 from last week after going for almost 20 FP and looks to be the TE1 for the Titans now. ($3,800) showed his immense ceiling last week and is still crazy cheap, while ($4,400) and ($4,500) are my favorite plays in the $4k range.</li></ul><ul><li>The Broncos ($2,700) defense remains my favorite for the price along with the Panthers ($3,300).</li></ul><p>Keep checking <a href=#>LineupHQ</a> for any projections changes throughout the week, as the best p/$ plays could change in an instant if someone gets ruled out or some other type of news makes someone likely to see more or less volume.</p><h3><span class=caps>NFL</span> <span class=caps>DFS</span> – RotoGrinders Premium Tools Pre-Lock</h3><p>If you have any tough lineup decisions or need some quick picks, be sure to check out the <a href=#>Consensus Value Rankings</a>, Expert Survey, and LineupHQ tags from our <span class=caps>DFS</span> experts.</p><p>For up-to-the-minute news and analysis leading right up to lock, make sure to follow the <a href=#>RotoGrinders <span class=caps>NFL</span> Twitter feed</a> and our <a href=#><span class=caps>NFL</span> <span class=caps>DFS</span> Alerts page</a>.</p><p>Good luck this week!</p><p>Image Credit: Imagn</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqn6m8qL7Ip5ueqqNjsLC5jpqpraGTobK0e82fo2aclqh6sb7Oo5ycrJmku7R5zqmroqWZr7KzedWao66do2LEprHKZmhuZWNtfXGAlmk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
