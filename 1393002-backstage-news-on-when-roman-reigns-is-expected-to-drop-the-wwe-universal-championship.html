The Head of the Table won the WWE Universal Championship at WWE Packback on August 30, 2020. A reign that has propelled him into the record books alongside some of the greatest WWE Champions of all time.
But if you were expecting Roman’s run to end anytime soon, I’m afraid we have some bad news."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When they think it’s the very best thing for business, they’ll know to switch it up, do it right, and really make someone doing it.”</p><p>The source justified Roman’s victory over Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 39 by saying that Reigns and Rhodes are hotter than ever as individual acts. Not to mention that Solo Sikoa and The Usos have greatly benefited from their continued association with The Tribal Chief.</p><p><a href=#>Seth Rollins: If Roman Reigns Did What I Do, We Wouldn’t Need A Secondary WWE Title</a></p><p>What do you make of this report?
