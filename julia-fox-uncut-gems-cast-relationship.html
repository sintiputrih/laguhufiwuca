Seriously indebted, Howard struggles to pay back his loan shark brother-in-law and becomes obsessed with an opal smuggled from Ethiopia, which is also the object of desire of <a href=#>NBA star Kevin Garnett</a> (who plays himself pre-retirement).</p><p>What stems from such a premise is a 134-minute pulse-pounding ride as we follow Howard trying to repay his debts and getting back with his soon-to-be ex-wife Dinah ('Frozen' star Idina Menzel) and tragically failing at both. Julia, however, remains by his side, setting up for a jaw-dropping finale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Julia Fox Reveals Sexuality To Famous Con Artist</a></span></p><p>Recently, Fox said that she was Josh and Benny Safdie's muse and that she has inspired the character of Julia De Fiore. While Josh Safdie confirmed Julia read the script in Los Angeles in 2014 and asked him if he had been spying on her given the similarities, the character wasn't deliberately inspired by her.</p><p>However, both Safdies knew Fox before 'Uncut Gems', so it's possible they were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">indirectly inspired by her when writing the role of De Fiore</a>.</p><p>"When she finished [reading the script], Julia asked me if I had been spying on her because she thought that there were so many strange similarities with the character," Josh Safdie told 'The New York Times' in 2019.</p><p>"But she gave me good feedback, so I would call her on a whim when I had writer's block, and I would ask her for advice. The character was just kind of constantly evolving to become more specific to her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-sandler-changed-the-name-of-fox-s-character-in-uncut-gems><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Adam Sandler Changed The Name Of Fox's Character In 'Uncut Gems'</span></h2><p>Despite the similarities to the real Julia, the 'Uncut Gems' character wasn't always called Julia, too.

I was filthy in this movie.
