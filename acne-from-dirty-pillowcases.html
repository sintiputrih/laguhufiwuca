"Over the course of a few days, dead skin cells, oil, and bacteria can build up on the pillow's surface. These three components may lead to acne breakouts."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And don't forget your haircare products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Hair gels, oils, and conditioning agents, can not only lead to clogging of the pores, but also potentially cause irritation of the skin," adds Marisa Garshick, MD, FAAD, board-certified dermatologist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery</a> in New York.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-so-how-often-should-you-change-your-pillowcases></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>So, How Often Should You Change Your Pillowcases?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before COVID-19, Dr. Mack says she would recommend switching your pillowcases every two to three days and the rest of your bedding every week. Now, she says every day or every other day is ideal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Given the increase in the amount of time we are spending in bed, I now recommend changing pillow cases every day or every other day," She says. "To minimize breakouts and reduce oil, I recommend cotton pillow cases. Breathable fabrics like cotton minimize the transfer of oil and help to reduce breakouts."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Garshick adds silk pillowcases can be a good option for those with both acne-prone and sensitive skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"While silk pillowcases are often considered for their possible benefits for hair and wrinkles, they don't absorb as much moisture as cotton, making them a good option for those with sensitive skin," she explains. "While more studies are needed, it is possible looking for fabrics with antimicrobial properties, such as those that incorporate silver or zinc technologies, may also provide some benefit, but still is not a substitute for washing your face regularly."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-skincare-routine-to-treat-these-breakouts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Skincare Routine to Treat These Breakouts?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from changing your pillowcases more often, making a few tweaks to your skincare routine can also help clear up these breakouts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Garshick says if you're noticing an increase in pimples, possibly related to dirty pillowcases, it's important to cleanse twice a day to ensure you're removing dirt and oil buildup that accumulates on the skin overnight and during the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For this it is best to stick with a gentle cleanser that is non-comedogenic and won't dry the skin out, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>CeraVe's Hydrating Cream to Foam Cleanser </a>or if you prefer a bar, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Dove Beauty Ba</a>r," she suggests. "If you are generally on the dry side and can't tolerate even a gentle cleanser, another option to cleanse the skin is using micellar water, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow">Simple Micellar Cleansing Water</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At night, Dr. Mack suggests adding a product with benzoyl peroxide, a tried-and-true acne-fighting ingredient, or a vitamin A derivative such as<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> Differin Gel</a>, an over-the-counter retinoid that can be used to help reduce whiteheads and blackheads.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Garshick adds that salicylic acid is another ingredient to look for when targeting acne, because it helps clear the skin by eliminating dead skin cells and oil from pores.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: When You Apply Sunscreen in Your Skincare Routine Actually Matters A Lot</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both dermatologists agree it's equally important to moisturize, specifically with a non-comedogenic formula that won't further clog pores.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One final tip: Dr. Mack suggests pulling your hair up and out of your face before bed to help minimize oil and residue from hair products touching your face.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1omJymlWKzs7vMZpuiqqSuerG1y6WmsJuRqLK0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
