Thus, among many opportunities, she chose to join </span><i><span>Survivor 43</span></i><span> because this was where she wanted “the beginning of the rest of (her) life to happen.”</span></p><p><span>This Cassidy Clark Bio explores her life.</span></p><h3><b>Cassidy Clark On Survivor 43</b></h3><p><span>Cassidy Clark is a big fan of the </span><i><span>Survivor</span></i><span> series. She started watching the show ever since she was four years, and has never missed a season or an episode. “I grew up and evolved with Survivor as Survivor grew and changed along with me. This is something I’ve wanted to do since I was a kid,” she added.</span></p><p><span>So, now that Cassidy’s a part of </span><i><span>Survivor</span></i><span> season 43, the experience is “surreal” to her. The pleasure of holding, nourishing, and manifesting a dream of 22 years into the waking world definitely holds pure magic. But being a part of the new era, Cassidy was a bit unhappy with the “risks associated with everything.”</span></p><p><span>In the past, contestants used to be able to rely on finding immunity idols and things like that to save themselves in the game. But now, if you find an idol, it’s a “Beware Advantage.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“You lose your vote, which is so crucial, especially in the early stage of the game and especially on a smaller tribe,” Cassidy explained.</span></p><p><span>As for her game plan, Cassidy was looking for an alliance with someone she could deeply connect with.&nbsp; She wanted somebody who was not going to make super rash decisions, not just going to be trying to do a million things at once and talk to a million people. Rather, someone who can step back, take calculated risks and think things through.</span></p><p><span>Her very bubbly, warm personality was almost comparable to former contestants Nick Wilson and Christian Hubicki.</span></p><h3><b>Cassidy Clark Age</b></h3><p><span>Cassidy Clark was 26 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span>Survivor 43</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><p><span>She was one of the young contestants that season.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Cassidy Clark Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Cassidy Clark was born to her parents, Rose Clark, and an anonymous father.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, her parents divorced when she was just a kid.</span></p><p><span>Before the divorce, Cassidy, her siblings, mom, and dad, everyone used to watch&nbsp; </span><i><span>Survivor</span></i><span> together. “That was really the most special memory for me, being together as a family watching Survivor. The show really holds those values of family and being a whole single unit,” she recalled.</span></p><p><span>And post-divorce, Cassidy was raised by her single mother, and for this, she considers her mother to be her hero. “She has faced so much adversity and never allowed it to break her spirit,” the contestant praised her mother. And naturally, when Cassidy’s mother saw this, she teared up.</span></p><p><span>Talking in detail about Cassidy’s mother, Rose Clark, she was a drunkard who tried to drink herself to death for three years. In 2020, she then “made the choice to live again” and with some help, she’s now 2 years sober.</span></p><p><span>Here’s her Fb @</span><a href=#><span>Roseclark4</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>As for Cassidy’s siblings, she has two older twin brothers (Casey and Christian Clark) and a sister Catherine (who’s long passed away).</span></p><p><span>Her brothers, Casey and Christian graduated in Jule 2013.</span></p><h3><b>Cassidy Clark Boyfriend</b></h3><p><span>Cassidy Clark loved her boyfriend Matthew Harrison to the moon.</span></p><p><span>The two started dating in August 2019.</span></p><p><span>According to Cassidy, her boyfriend was “the most precious thing (she) ever had the pleasure of gazing upon.” He made her each day “blissful”. And also, he was the one who healed her broken heart.</span></p><p><span>Together, the lovebirds have been to Nevada, California; Barbarella Austin; and more places for vacations.</span></p><p><span>Now, talking a little about Matthew, he was completing his Master’s degree in ecology, evolution, systematics, and population biology at </span><i><span>Texas State University</span></i><span> in 2022.&nbsp; Here’s his IG @</span><a href=#><span>matt_harr3</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Prior to Matthew, Cassidy dated Jaxon Fields, an insurance agent working for </span><i><span>J.
