This ensures that there is minimal wait time for passengers.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that the frequency of shuttles may vary depending on several factors, including the time of day, day of the week, and hotel occupancy.</p><p><strong>During off-peak hours, such as late at night or early in the morning, the frequency of shuttles may be reduced.</strong></p><p>It’s always a good idea to check with your hotel for their specific shuttle schedule and any potential changes during your stay.</p><h3>On-Demand vs Timed Shuttles</h3><p><strong>Some hotels offer on-demand shuttle services, while others operate on a timed schedule.</strong></p><p>On-demand shuttles allow guests to request a pickup from the airport whenever they arrive, providing flexibility and convenience.
