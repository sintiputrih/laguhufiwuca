With success, he joined forces with other thought leaders, governors and large corporations to pledge to make Juneteenth an officially recognized holiday as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;movement was powerful and took on a life of its own, with President Biden declaring Juneteenth a national holiday.</p><p>So this year, Pharrell will bring&nbsp;SOMETHING&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;WATER&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;nation’s capital, on an important weekend&nbsp;inthe&nbsp;country’s history, to recognize that&nbsp;something&nbsp;that has been flowing through&nbsp;the&nbsp;country’s soil for over 400 years. Pharrell will gather&nbsp;the&nbsp;biggest artists on&nbsp;the&nbsp;nation’s front doorstep to show what this day means and provide a glimpse of its potential.</p><p>With&nbsp;the&nbsp;festival’s emphasis on community, this year Pharrell will bring together&nbsp;the&nbsp;DMV (DC, Maryland, and Virginia) to highlight and uplift&nbsp;the&nbsp;communities across&nbsp;the&nbsp;region.&nbsp;The&nbsp;festival has strived to fight systemic issues for historically marginalized communities as it relates to opportunities&nbsp;in&nbsp;education, business and jobs, and this year is no different. While&nbsp;the&nbsp;festival itself has relocated to Washington, DC,&nbsp;the&nbsp;impact of SITW on behalf of&nbsp;the757 remains strong with sponsors showing up to support Hampton Roads with subsequent community engagements beyond&nbsp;the&nbsp;festival, many of which will be activated through Pharrell’s 501(c)(3) non-profit, YELLOW, whose mission is to EVEN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;ODDS through education.&nbsp; Sponsor details and local activations to be announced soon.&nbsp;</p><p>“SOMETHING&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;WATER&nbsp;is a Black solution (LOVE) for a systemic issue, and this year we are taking our celebration to a higher platform –&nbsp;the&nbsp;nation’s Capital during Juneteenth Weekend.&nbsp; We want to show&nbsp;the&nbsp;world that&nbsp;there is&nbsp;SOMETHING&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;WATER&nbsp;across&nbsp;the&nbsp;whole DMV and I want to continue to bring awareness to&nbsp;the&nbsp;greatness within&nbsp;these communities and&nbsp;invite large corporations to show up for&nbsp;the&nbsp;people. DC has always been a deep&nbsp;inspiration to me as a person and a musician.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;the&nbsp;land where Go- Go Music was birthed which has provided so much for our people.&nbsp; Our sponsors continue to go&nbsp;the&nbsp;extra mile to show that&nbsp;SOMETHING&nbsp;INTHE&nbsp;WATER&nbsp;is so much more than a festival.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;goodwill we generate is a defining trait of who we are.&nbsp; We will always have&nbsp;the&nbsp;hottest artists, but to pair that energy with&nbsp;these brands showing up for&nbsp;the&nbsp;community is what makes this festival a vehicle for change,” said Pharrell.</p><p>“If you’re celebrating music, if you’re celebrating Black excellence, if you’re drawing attention to&nbsp;the&nbsp;people who have dedicated&nbsp;their lives to knocking down barriers and uplifting our communities —&nbsp;then&nbsp;there is no better place to do that than&nbsp;in&nbsp;Washington, DC,” said Mayor Muriel Bowser. “We are proud to be working with Pharrell to bring&nbsp;SOMETHING&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;WATER&nbsp;to DC for Juneteenth weekend. DC is open and we are ready to celebrate.”</p><p>Founded by Pharrell Williams&nbsp;in&nbsp;2020, Black Ambition was launched as a non-profit&nbsp;initiative that provides a bridge to success for Black and Latinx entrepreneurs launching tech, Web 3.0, healthcare, and consumer products/service start-ups. Its long-term vision is for&nbsp;inclusive entrepreneurship to be&nbsp;the&nbsp;new normal. Black Ambition will be hosting a 25k pitch competition at SITW for local DC entrepreneurs and startup founders, hosting a series of panel discussions and fireside chats on funding, Web 3.0 and mentorship for Black and Latinx startup founders and a marketplace to showcase&nbsp;the&nbsp;products of&nbsp;the&nbsp;first year of Black Ambition founders. Black Ambition is committed to leveling&nbsp;the&nbsp;playing field and fostering&nbsp;the&nbsp;ingenuity, determination, and resilience of underrepresented entrepreneurs.</p><p>XQ&nbsp;Institute will also join this year’s festival to host&nbsp;interactive, community-centered events highlighting XQ’s emerging partnership with DC Public Schools and to commemorate&nbsp;the&nbsp;2022 graduating class of high school students across&nbsp;the&nbsp;nation.</p><p>Sunday will feature&nbsp;the&nbsp;return of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Pop-Up Church Service from a stage&nbsp;in&nbsp;West Potomac Park, home of&nbsp;theMartin Luther King Jr. Memorial.&nbsp; This event will be free for&nbsp;the&nbsp;community,&nbsp;the&nbsp;lineup will be announced soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Washington, DC fully embraces Pharrell’s vision of promoting music, culture, diversity and&nbsp;the&nbsp;importance of empowering youth&nbsp;in&nbsp;our community,” said Ralph Morton, senior vice president and managing director, Sports & Entertainment Division at Events DC.&nbsp; “SOMETHING&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;WATER&nbsp;will become a powerful tradition&nbsp;in&nbsp;DC, attracting visitors from around&nbsp;the&nbsp;country to our nation’s capital as we celebrate Juneteenth weekend.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.livenationentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image.png><p><strong>About&nbsp;SOMETHING&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;WATER</strong></p><p>Launched&nbsp;in&nbsp;Virginia Beach, VA&nbsp;in&nbsp;2019, Pharrell’s&nbsp;SOMETHING&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;WATER&nbsp;shines a light on&nbsp;the&nbsp;best and brightest of&nbsp;the&nbsp;region and captures&nbsp;the&nbsp;attention of a global audience.
