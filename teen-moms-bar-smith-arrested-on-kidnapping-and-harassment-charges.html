The exes, who share 5-year-old daughter Holly, seemingly broke up in 2023 after Smith posted and deleted a breakup announcement.</p><p>“I have had amazing times and learned so many things from Ashley. I will forever be grateful for everything but unfortunately, we have come to unforeseen issues and people grow apart,” Smith wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> in May 2023. “There is no specific blame being placed on either end but we had both respectfully agreed to part ways [and] continue with life unfortunately without each other I will always be there when I’m needed and so will she, but the time to separate has come.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Teen-Moms-Bar-Smith-Arrested-on-Kidnapping-and-Harassment-Charges-2.jpg><p>When <i>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</i> kicked off a brand-new season one year later, Siren, 27, revealed her ex was residing in California after being sentenced to 24 months on probation for a separate case.
