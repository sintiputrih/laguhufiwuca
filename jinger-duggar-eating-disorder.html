The extremely conservative, fundamentalist Christian family — headed by Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar — soon became household names not only for their number of children but also for the strict rules they imposed.

This led to some harmful behaviors, including the eating disorder I developed early in my teenage years," she wrote in Becoming Free Indeed.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jinger continued: "Convinced my body was an embarrassment, I ate very little. I'd go days hardly consuming any calories. My weight dropped, but my body image didn't improve. It almost never does in those situations because the weight isn't the problem."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jinger said her mom, Michelle Duggar, helped her through her eating disorder.</h2><p>Those who were avid watchers of 19 Kids and Counting, might remember <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle speaking about having an eating disorder</a> when she was younger. Thankfully, Michelle was able to support Jinger when she was struggling with similar issues as a teenager.</p><p>"Thankfully, my eating struggles were short-lived, in large part due to my mom's help," Jinger wrote in her 2023 book.</p><p>"She asked me to text her what I was eating and how often," Jinger continued. "She also monitored my workout schedule and even turned this into an opportunity to keep her accountable with working out. It was a great way for us to be partners in taking care of our health."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>At the end of the day during this time, the Duggar matriarch would encourage her daughter to "make wise choices and get the right number of calories to sustain my body and thrive," Jinger wrote, noting that she "didn't feel judged at all" by Michelle.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She added: "My mom had shared with me what she's shared with the world: She had struggled with her eating, too, when she was my age.
