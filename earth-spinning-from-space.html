I didn’t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.”</p><p>In its nearly 60-year history, NASA has often worked to share that very experience with those of us who can’t take off in rockets.</p><p>With that mission in mind, NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies released a time-lapse video of our planet like you’ve never seen it before: rotating through one full year, as seen from a million miles away.</p><p>The video is composed of thousands of photographs taken by the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) aboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), the first deep-space satellite dedicated to photographing our planet.</p><p>The photos in question are so well-lit because of the probe’s perfect positioning in a unique piece of space real estate called Lagrange point 1.</p><p>“This orbit is a gravity neutral point in space, allowing DSCOVR to essentially hover between the sun and Earth at all times, maintaining a constant view of the sun and sun-lit side of Earth,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which operates DSCOVR, <a href=#>explains</a>.</p><p>“From here, the satellite can provide advanced solar measurements and early warnings of potentially dangerous space weather events, acting as a solar storm buoy in deep space.”</p><p>The probe, which was first proposed by then-Vice President Al Gore, helps scientists monitor weather and climate changes.</p><p>And less importantly but perhaps more interestingly, it helped us finally see the dark side of the moon:</p><p>Next, read about how <a href=#>NASA will create a homemade Aurora light to show in America’s skies</a>.
