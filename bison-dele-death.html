Dele, Dabord’s girlfriend, <strong>Serena Karlan</strong>, and skipper&nbsp;<strong>Bertrand Saldo&nbsp;</strong>sailed from Tahiti on his watercraft on July 6, 2002. Surprisingly, his brother was also on the ship according to the satellite phone calls made during that month.&nbsp;</p><ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex"><li class=blocks-gallery-item><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/tucson-1.jpg></li></ul><p>In the early days of the trip, basketball star Dele and Darlon were always in touch with their families. However, suddenly, the connection was lost. And finally, when the boat returned to Tahiti on&nbsp;July 20, 2002,&nbsp;there was only Dele’s brother, Miles Dabord, in the ship.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, that was it, the unfortunate disappearance of the NBA star, Bison Dele, Darlon, and skipper in the South Pacific ocean.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Investigation on Bison Dele’s Unfortunate Murder</h3><p>After the unfortunate murder of the retired Chicago Bulls man, <strong>Bison Dele</strong>, the police conducted a sting operation to find out the hidden truths behind the death. The cops caught Dabord on&nbsp;September 5, 2002<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>since he bought massive gold worth&nbsp;<strong>$152 thousand&nbsp;</strong>by using his brother’s name and a forged signature.</p><p><strong>You may also like: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Sela Vave's dating rumors with Jamie Foxx (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Sela Vave’s dating rumors with Jamie Foxx</a>.</strong></p><p>Finally, the police concluded that it was Dele’s brother Dabord who killed him, his girlfriend, and the captain. Since the boat, Hukuna Matata, had patched bullet holes and nameplate removed, police claimed that Dabord shot all three and threw the bodies in the ocean.</p><p>Dele’s brother Dabord blamed the departed NBA star, claiming that it was he who pushed his wife, Darlon, and the boat’s captain. Consequently, he had to kill him in the attempt of self-defense in his version of the story.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding more twist to the tale, Dabord intentionally overdosed in insulin that put him in a coma. Eventually, he died at the California hospital on&nbsp;September 27, 2002.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bison_Dele_and_NBA></span>Bison Dele and NBA<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The late NBA star, Bison Dele started his NBA journey when he was the tenth pick in the first round of 1991 NBA draft for Orlando Magic.
