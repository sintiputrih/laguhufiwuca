One insider report claims it’s all because Kourt realized something about her ex, Scott Disick’s current girlfriend.</p><p>Kylie and Sofia are spending a lot of time together lately, including on exotic and luxe vacations, even ahead of the Jenner’s birthday tomorrow!</p><p>The change apparently happened when Kourtney understood Sofia’s intentions with the father of her children.</p><p>One source tells HollywoodLife that ‘Kourtney really struggled with Sofia and Scott dating at first because of Sofia’s age…Kylie and Sofia’s friendship took a backseat out of respect for Kourtney. Kourtney has completely come around now and realizes Sofia is a good girl who won’t be going anywhere.’</p><p>Now, Kourtney ‘has absolutely no problem with Kylie and Sofia being so close. Kourtney coming around was the final ticket for Sofia and Kylie to get even closer.’</p><p>In the meantime, ‘Sofia felt she was very patient in getting the Kardashians to accept her and she’s relieved they’re now in the place where she can go away with Kylie Jenner and it’s no big deal. She’s had multiple discussions with the family and did understand their concerns.’</p><p>The young model is really grateful that she is in such a great place with Kylie as well as the rest of the Kardashian-Jenners.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>She could not have asked for more since they really welcomed her with open arms.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebqsSsedKonaKZXae2pLTInqpmnqKesq%2Bw0qGgqWWnnsGpecqyo6KdXZ%2Byr7rEq2Sgp6RiwLW%2BzqeenqpdlrO1sdFmoqitoqm7psWMpJirnJGotaqtzWaYnJuVpcGmsIyhnKtlmJq%2Fpr%2BMsJ%2ByZWNlhnqCl2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
