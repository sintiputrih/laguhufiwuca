February can be the coldest month — especially when it’s the February following a particularly hellish year and you didn’t get around to cuffing someone for the season. Or maybe you just generally dislike displays of affection and consumeristic cash-grabs. Either way, February, and particularly February 14, is a loaded period of time whether you’re in a relationship or not. Feelings are at an all-time high, and not all of those feelings are necessarily loving."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Take solace in the fact you’re not alone with the Schadenfreude of these terrifyingly titillating titles. Picnics and parties gone awry, lovers who<br>aren’t what they seem, killer Cupids and maladjusted meet-cutes — Valentine’s Day may seem bad, but it could always be worse.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckkzr6ldm001u3h6g3c7wej5v@published data-word-count=37>This February 14, pick your poison, grab some sweets, and indulge. After all, love is terrifying — and so is an annual holiday designated to celebrating it publicly. Might as well embrace the horror of the season.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckkzrgtkd002h3h6gzbokjj4o@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckkzrgpil002d3h6gv0ek9i0k@published data-word-count=63>In 1900s Victoria, Australia, a group of students and two teachers from an all-girls private school trek to a geological formation known as Hanging Rock. It’s Valentine’s Day and this collection of women hope to enjoy a quiet picnic near the rock formation. Instead, three students and an instructor go missing after a bizarre and disturbing trance on the top of the rock.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckkzrnjez003h3h6g76x6y825@published data-word-count=36>Based on the 1967 book by Joan Lindsay, who had intentionally kept the veracity of the story ambiguous, Picnic at Hanging Rock has that might-be-true feel, keeping the creepiness at an all-time high throughout its runtime.</p>Available to stream on HBO Max <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>HBO Max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckkzrmm2e003a3h6gq49kmfnb@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>My Bloody Valentine (1981)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckkzrmhcd00343h6gqvof9wku@published data-word-count=79>Quentin Tarantino’s favorite slasher, My Bloody Valentine takes Valentine’s Day underground. Literally. After two inattentive supervisors leave a group of miners trapped underground following a methane explosion during a Valentine’s Day dance, one miner must cannibalize his deceased comrades to survive until he is freed from the shaft — a week later. Driven mad, the miner goes on a kind-of-understandable rampage on the following Valentine’s Day, to deter the mining town from ever having a Valentine’s Day dance again.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckkzrno2u003n3h6gdur8o1dt@published data-word-count=19>Fast-forward 20 years: The mayor tries to reinstate a Valentine’s Day dance only for the killing to begin again.</p>Available to stream on Hulu <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Hulu</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckkzrmcna002y3h6gfh5qxwrn@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Bride of Re-Animator (1989)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckkzqzmca00133h6g3n2rs0mg@published data-word-count=100>There’s a perfect person for everyone — unless that person is dead. Then, you have to reconstruct a body using your dead lover’s heart as the centerpiece. This is the plot of Re-Animator’s sequel, Bride of Re-Animator. Released on Valentine’s Day, Bride of Re-Animator follows the singleminded Herbert West in his attempt to create the perfect woman — from corpses. Taking advantage of the grief-stricken Dan Cain, who’s fiancée met her untimely demise in the first Re-Animator installment, West begins cobbling together limbs and ligaments in this comedic reimagining of The Bride of Frankenstein.

And these are both important lessons for this particular holiday. In short, don’t be jealous of lovey-dovey couples or parade your relationship all over social media to spite the singles — instead, have an old friend for dinner.</p>Available to stream on HBO Max <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>HBO Max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckkzsqoa1005f3h6gpylnol93@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Valentine (2001)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckkzsqjou00593h6gkj0xss2g@published data-word-count=89>Director of Urban Legend Jamie Blanks takes ’90s and early aughts mainstays Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, and Katherine Heigl and asks, “What if a guy in a Cupid masks started killing co-eds on Valentine’s Day?” and then gave us … exactly that.<br>Critics panned this one for being too similar to ’80s slashers (as if that’s a bad thing?)but this ridiculous romp — and its ridiculous twist — is the perfect flick to gleefully remind you that relationships sometimes aren’t all they’re cracked up to be.</p>Available to stream on Tubi <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Tubi</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckkzt1own006l3h6gvnaxwmyc@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Love Witch (2016)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckkzqzmdk00143h6gdxyf63cv@published data-word-count=89>Although it looks like it was made in the psychedelic ’60s (it’s a loving homage, filmed in 35mm Technicolor), The Love Witch is a modern story about a modern woman looking for love — leaving bodies in her wake. Director Anna Biller expertly pairs female fantasy with the trope of the<br>femme fatale. This is the flick to watch if you’re single and need a reminder that being alone is better than being dead. Or if you’re in a relationship and want to give a toxic warning to your partner.</p>Available to stream on Peacock, Tubi, and other services. <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Peacock</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Tubi</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckkzsuulk00603h6g6bkcmeri@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Happy Death Day 2U (2019)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckkzsuqed005u3h6gfwucqnoe@published data-word-count=116>Do you ever feel like you and your significant other are stuck in a loop, doing the same ol’ day in and day out? Did you feel this way even before 2020?<br>The sequel to Happy Death Day, released on Valentine’s Day, shows what it could be like if you were trapped in an alternate universe where your partner is with someone else and you have to keep dying to avoid watching your loved ones be murdered. This one will make you appreciate what you have. Or grateful for what you don’t have: the obligation to constantly sacrifice yourself for someone else. Either way, this sci-fi-horror-comedy makes for a fun, violent jaunt.
