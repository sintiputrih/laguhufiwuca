“I’ve always had thick skin,” he told  ahead of Smackdown Live‘s debut on Fox. “I’m lucky I guess because people can’t hurt my feelings."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But I also think that those people are going to be negative regardless. There’s nothing you can do to please these people, but the good thing is they’re also telling you what they don’t like, so you can use that in your character.</p><p class=body-text>“Like I put on a suit vest and everybody on social media said, ‘He looks ridiculous, why does he have a suit vest? I hate the suit vest’. So what am I going to do? I’m going to wear the suit vest. That’s my job, my job is to irritate you and you’re telling me how.”</p><p>“Cutting the hair felt good. I was ready to cut my hair,” Corbin said. “It becomes very taxing to have to go through the process of dealing with long hair, it can be a nightmare sometimes.”</p><p class=body-text>“But having to put on the suit and tie and go to work, it kind of felt like I sold my soul to The Man and I think everybody does it at least once in their life, where you have to just accept the role or position in a job where you have to wear a suit and tie.</p><p class=body-text>“So you have to put that suit and tie on, but you’re still the same thing underneath and I think that allowed me to just elevate to the level where I’m at. It’s gotten me to the top of the card, it’s gotten me in title matches. So there was a good reason to do that. I’ve still got the tattoos underneath, I’m still carrying the spirit. But yeah, every once in a while you’ve got to put on a suit and go to work. So that’s what I had to do.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBtamlwaGKvor7Op2Scp6KXtq951rCcZqyYnrCsedKkoKc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
