The "Sex Life" actress shot to fame following her role in the series, where she played a pregnant love interest and left fans wondering if she was really pregnant.</p><p class=dh>On March 28, Day took to Instagram to share a picture of herself lying in bed in a pair of Kelvin Klein underwear and a white tank top. She sported a blonde pixie cut with her natural roots showing and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CqVpI1gLk9w>captioned</a> the post, "laazzzzy day."</p><p class=dh>In the comments section, social media users could not believe how stunning the actress looked, with one person <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CqVpI1gLk9w>writing</a>, "If only I could look this good on a lazy day. You should see me right now, I look like the trash."</p><p class=dh>Day <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CqVpI1gLk9w>revealed</a> that she was "v tired (sic)" to a user who noted she looked different, and they <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CqVpI1gLk9w>responded</a>, "Yet, somehow managed to look like this !!!" Another person <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CqVpI1gLk9w>commented</a>, "I wanted to send you a poem, but you are the most beautiful verse that life has ever written. Just an angel that God put in this world to shine."</p><p class=dh>As a young girl, people always told Day she looked like a model. So one day, she did something about it and found an agency in London. By the time she was 15, she was hanging out with other models, sneaking into after-parties, and making it back to her parents' home during the early hours of the morning before she had to get up for school.</p><p class=dh>Day's modeling career funded her studies at the Sylvia Young Theatre School and the Arts Educational Schools in London. However, acting ultimately won her heart. The actress <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.maxim.com/entertainment/meet-british-model-actress-wallis-day/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I fell in love with acting more because it allows so much freedom and movement in front of the screen, creating a character and backstory, bringing that to life. With modeling, it's somebody else's vision, someone else's creative decisions. Essentially I feel like a mannequin for a brand or client rather than I was creating."</p><p class=dh>While Day's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5363417/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">acting career</a> has seen her star in multiple hit projects, her popularity skyrocketed after she landed the role of Gigi, <a class="me a" href=#>Adam Demos'</a> on-screen love interest in "Sex Life." Day's character is pregnant in the show's second season, and her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/wallis-day-pregnant>hyper-realistic baby bump</a> left fans wondering if the actress was pregnant in real life. However, she set the record straight and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CpVd4UXIsV1>said</a>, "That wasn't my real belly. They're prosthetics."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1na2hoaXq4rculoKxllJbGbr%2FHmqmeq12dsrN5y5qxsmWUlsZuvMeoq6hlkaOxb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
