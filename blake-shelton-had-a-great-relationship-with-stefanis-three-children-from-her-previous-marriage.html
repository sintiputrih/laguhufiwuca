Three years into their relationship, Shelton claimed that he and Stefani both felt they were having a “rebound” affair and that their relationship wouldn’t proceed any farther.</p><p>“If Gwen and I were being really honest… “I think we both sort of felt in the back of our minds, ‘This is a comeback thing because we’re both coming out of really terrible periods in our lives,'” he added. “To go through this, we’re sort of clinging to one other.”</p><p>Shelton and Stefani, on the other hand, confirmed their engagement on October 27, 2020, after five years together. They will marry a year later, on July 3, 2021, at his property in Oklahoma.&nbsp;It’s been nearly seven years since the two first met, and their bond is only becoming stronger. Aside from Shelton and Stefani, he also has a great bond with her three children.</p><h2>Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani’s Children</h2><p>Stefani’s three children from her former marriage with Bush lead singer and guitarist Gavin Rossdale — Kingston, Zuma, and Apollo — have a terrific connection with Shelton.&nbsp;InTouch stated in 2020 that Stefani’s children were “well-adjusted” to her relationship with Shelton, citing a source.</p><p>“They [Stefani’s children] have the impression that they have two fathers,” a source claimed. “There haven’t been any major concerns thus yet.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Blake-Shelton-2.jpg alt="Blake Shelton" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to the publication, although Shelton and Rossdale were not “buddies,” they engaged with one other in a polite manner.</p><p>“They [Shelton and Rossdale] say hello if they happen to be in the same room when the kids are dropped off or picked up… Gavin and Blake will generally respond with a head nod and a ‘What’s up?’ That’s all.”</p><p>Shelton has also expressed his admiration for Stefani’s boys. He said that he understood he had lost out on a lot by not becoming a father.&nbsp;The singer also said that although he had previously ruled out having children of his own, he was having a fantastic time with Kingston, Zuma, and Apollo.</p><h2>Gavin Rossdale and Gwen Stefani</h2><p>Stefani met Rossdale for the first time in 1995 when his band played at a Christmas performance for radio station KROQ. On September 14, 2002, seven years after their first encounter, the two married at St Paul’s, Covent Garden, London. Two weeks later, the pair married again in Los Angeles.&nbsp;Stefani and Rossdale became parents for the first time in May 2006, when Kingston was born.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Blake-Shelton-3.jpg alt="Blake Shelton" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Zuma and Apollo, their second boys, were born in August 2008 and February 2014, respectively.&nbsp;Unfortunately, on August 3, 2015, a year after Apollo’s birth, Stefani filed for divorce from Rossdale, alleging “irreconcilable disagreements.” On April 8, 2016, the divorce was finalized. Rossdale’s three-year romance with the family’s longstanding nanny, Mindy Mann, was subsequently revealed to be the cause of their breakup.&nbsp;According to reports, Rossdale originally denied there was nothing going on between himself and Mann, but subsequently admitted it.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZpZmbmnq0tMSlq6imXZ2upXnAZp6rnZGperOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIywoK2gXajBprLAp6CsZaSdv6axjJyfoqSUp7KvecWrpqZlmJq%2FbrzRnq2ip6Woeq6t0augmp%2BVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
