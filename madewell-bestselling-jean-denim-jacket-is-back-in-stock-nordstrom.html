It’s made in a classic blue wash that can fit any season — be it spring, summer or fall. Madewell has produced <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">this jacket</a> in both regular and plus sizes, which is absolutely ideal. You can get exactly the right fit and look that you want with their range of options, and we’re obviously thrilled that Madewell is inclusive with their sizing.</p><p>This jacket is made from 100% cotton denim that’s been treated to look lightly distressed and faded, giving it a soft vintage look. It’s crafted in a classic style that’s meant to hit right at the hips, and has two lower slip pockets and two chest button flap pockets. The sleeves on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">this jacket</a> are bracelet length, meaning that they’re meant to cut off just above the wrist. The metal buttons on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">this denim jacket</a> have a shiny copper-tone color to them, which contrasts beautifully with the bright blue material.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Madewell-Denim-Jacket-Pinter-Wash-2.jpeg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Madewell Denim Jacket</a> (originally $118) on sale for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$89</a>, available at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p>Shoppers say that “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">this jacket</a> is a stylish update on a basic with its cute copper buttons” and that they love how “this jacket fits with a ton of looks.” Many reviewers have reported that they find <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">the jacket</a> can run a tad small, or in some cases slightly large, depending on your frame — so use your discretion when selecting the right size for you. If you prefer a fitted look, ordering your regular size should be fine — but if you want a roomier jacket then definitely size up.</p><p>Nordstrom devotees are calling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">this Madewell number</a> “truly the perfect jean jacket” and say that it’s definitely a “classic” fashion staple.
