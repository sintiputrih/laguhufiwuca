Alexei made the decision to leave his country and his career as a medic. They both made sacrifices for the chance at something real and everlasting, and their belief in love is how they became&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé's sweetest couples</a>.</p><h2 id=birthright-the-moment-they-met><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Birthright: The Moment They Met</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/loren-and-alexei-.jpg><p>Loren and Alexei met while she was on a Birthright trip, something anyone with confirmed Jewish heritage is permitted to take prior to a certain age. While it was intended to be a historical trip for Loren, what she likely didn't expect was for it to be historical in other ways - mainly, her love life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=over-the-course-of-one-year-loren-traveled-to-israel-five-times><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Over The Course Of One Year,&nbsp;Loren&nbsp;Traveled To Israel Five Times</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/loren-and-alexei-florida.png><p>Their relationship was a beautiful thing, and Loren went back to Israel a total of five times to see her soon-to-be fiancé. While they'd only spent five trips together, they knew something no one else did - that they had fallen in love. At least, according to their time on&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé.&nbsp;They quickly became one of few couples&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans thought could make it</a>.</p><h2 id=surprise-90-day-fianc-and-their-wedding-plans><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Surprise! 90 Day Fiancé And Their Wedding Plans</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/loren-alexei-90-day-fiance.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While on the show, Loren and Alexei spoke of their wedding plans and went through the process of breaking the news to Loren's family. She and her parents flew into Canada to meet Alexei, since he had not been approved as a U.S. citizen yet, and that's where she broke the news. While it was taken fairly well by her mother, her father initially questioned the marriage.</p><h2 id=they-had-two-weddings-september-2015-and-july-2016><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>They Had Two Weddings (September 2015 And July 2016)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/loren-and-alexei-wedding.jpg><p>The couple didn't have one conventional wedding.
