Luke Bryan beamed with pride over his eldest son, Thomas Boyer &#34;Bo&#34; Bryan, during a fishing trip. The singer shared a rare photo of Bo to show off his son's impressive catch.
In the photo, Luke Bryan is seen standing with his son Thomas next to the water and holding a big fish in his hands. Luke welcomed Thomas into the 10-pound club in the photo's caption and shared the fish's exact weight."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Luke welcomed Thomas into the 10-pound club in the photo's caption and shared the fish's exact weight.</p><p class=Fg>Fans congratulated young Bo Bryan in the comments, and many noticed that he looks just like his famous father. "I'm convinced there are 2 Luke Bryans here," one follower <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CsAQ87brAPZ/>wrote</a>. As some followers agreed, another added, "He looks just like u Luke."</p><p class=Fg>The country singer doesn't often share pictures of his children. One of the last photos featuring Bo is a family <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CaOQS1nl4f9/>portrait</a> from February 2022. Luke's wife, <a class="Xd a" href=#>Caroline Boyer</a>, provides a more frequent glimpse into their family life. She recently wished Bo a happy birthday.</p><p class=Fg>Thomas "Bo" Boyer was born on March 18, 2008. Both he and mother Caroline were doing great after labor, leaving Luke Bryan over the moon. Luke was present for the birth, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/luke-bryan-welc/>saying</a> he couldn't have missed watching his <a class="Xd a" href=#>wife</a> deliver their son.</p><p class=Fg>For Bo's birthday, Caroline Boyer <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp-6lRiu-az/?hl=en">shared</a> two photos showing how much he has grown. The last slide of her post is a video of Luke Bryan cheerfully trying to wake Thomas up.</p><p class=Fg>In her birthday wishes, Caroline refers to Bo as a "once tiny baby" who now turns 15. She also joked about needing medication when it's time to teach Bo how to drive.</p><p class=Fg>Luke and Caroline also have a younger son named Tatum Christopher, born on August 11, 2010. After <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/luke-bryan-welcomes-second-son/>Tatum's birth</a>, his famous father said that having one son was everything he ever hoped for. With two sons in his family, he was looking forward to having a lot of fun.</p><p class=Fg>This is especially true given Bryan's love of fishing. When he took 12-year-old Tatum fishing, Tate caught a 10-pound fish himself. Luke had to admit that it took him a long time to achieve such a feat as he <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CoukqTgD4wK/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"Took me 45 years to break 10 pounds. Tate did it in 12."</p><p class=Fg>In addition to his two sons, Luke Bryan also <a class="Xd a" href=#>takes care</a> of his nephew and nieces, as their parents, including his <a class="Xd a" href=#>sister</a>, have passed away.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1nbW5hZ3qtwcqeZJuqqZa7tHnFmqWsZZ6kwaqvxGafoqtdqLyvecGoZKWnn6DAb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
