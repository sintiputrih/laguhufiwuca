Before that, he served various roles at Tyson Foods and was allegedly a “champion of team member safety” and a member of the company’s Executive Safety Council.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-398683 alt="Razorback Stadium" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/razorback-stadium.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-398683 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Arkansas Razorback Football/Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>The Arkansas Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville, Arkansas.</span></p><p>Ramsey’s new role at Beyond Meat, however, has been marred by skepticism.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>CNBC</a>, the food company’s investors have expressed concern over disappointing sales, operating challenges, and long-term growth prospects.</p><p>Beyond Meat’s stock fell 73 percent this year, dropping its market cap down to $1.09 billion — a significant decrease from its $13.4 billion valuation just three years ago.</p><p>The incident could also carry significant financial repercussions for Ramsey.</p><p>When Ramsey joined Beyond Meat, he was given a $450,000 sign-on bonus, but according to an <a href=# rel=noopener>SEC filing from December</a>, he will be forced to pay back a pro-rated portion of the bonus “if for any reason his employment terminates within one year of his start date.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-398676 alt="Beyond Meat Burger" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/beyond-meat-burger.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-398676 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Beyond Meat/Twitter</span><span class=caption-body>Beyond Meat’s “McPlant” burger sold at McDonald’s won PETA’s “Best Vegan Burger” award in 2021.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Fortune</a> also reported that Ramsey had been set to receive an additional cash bonus of $275,000 on the anniversary of his start date — which he would naturally not receive if he were to be fired.</p><p>As of now, it’s unclear if Beyond Meat intends to sever ties with Ramsey, as both the company and Ramsey himself have not answered any outlets’ requests for comment.</p><p>Ramsey was released on Sunday after posting an $11,085 bond.
