Let’s face it, everyone likes to have finer things in life, and Lil Uzi is no exception.</p><p>His collection includes timepieces from world-renowned brands, mostly from Swiss makers.</p><p>First of all, he has a Rolex Sky-Dweller in Stainless steel with pave invisible honeycomb setting and a blue dial. The watch reference number 326934 costs about $55,000.</p><p>Likewise, another of his impressive and prized timepieces is his custom 41mm diamond-encrusted Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Skeleton. The watch is wrapped in 18k rose gold with an untouched dial showcasing its skeleton movement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lil-Uzis-Rolex.jpg><p>The value of the watch is an eye-watering $300,000.</p><p>Similarly, another most prized timepiece in his collection is his custom Iced out Richard Mille 030.</p><p>This has been mostly seen in his wrist on different occasions.</p><p>The standard price for the watch starts from $200,000, but with his personal custom bits and pieces, the price of the watch might have crossed the half-mile mark.</p><p>Apart from these watches, Lil Uzi has a Diamond encrusted Patek Philippe, G-Shock, and Franck Muller.</p><p>If we take all the watches into account, it’s an easy million to two just for the watch collection.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Just like his extravagant collection of timepieces, Uzi is so much into automobiles and owns a fleet of them.</p><p>The man with a million dollars worth of watch collection has splashed over another multi-million on his wheel collection.</p><p>Check it out, and let’s not drool over them; how about that.</p><h4>Rolls-Royce Cullinan</h4><p>As soon as Lil Uzi got his Rolls-Royce Cullinan around 2018, he straightened it up. The outside of the $350,000 luxury SUV was originally painted in seaweed green and had an all-tan interior.</p><p>The chrome rims clearly glimmered, but not as much as the diamond-encrusted hood ornament on the tip of the hood.</p><p>Though he decided to eventually spill the common battleship grey and orange accents on his other wheels, he kept that color scheme on this one for his most recent upgrade in January of 2020.</p><p>Under the hood is a 6.75-liter V12 engine capable of producing 563 brake horsepower and 627 pound-feet of torque.</p><h4>Bentley</h4><p>Lil Uzi had his Bentley Continental GT designed with the usual military green and black colors in 2019.</p><p>The doors of the car have the number 16 on them to represent where he’s from.</p><p>Other features on this vehicle include green snakeskin on the seats, a police package with strobe lights and sirens, red LED lights over the JL speaker system, and an off-road roll cage.</p><p>It’s not clear how much he paid for this piece of machine, but the 2021 version of this car retails at just over $200,000.</p><p>Likewise, Continental GT is not the only Bentley in his possession; he also owns black on black with orange-ish interior Bentley Bentayga Mansory, which he purchased back in 2017.</p><p>However, in 2019, Uzi dumped the black paint on the body and got it wrapped in military green.</p><p>Last January, he upgraded his wheel once more.</p><p>This time, the paint job was inspired by&nbsp;Beyond the Boundary&nbsp;and some iris-colored bladed rims.</p><p>Back in 2017, this car retailed for at least $200,000.</p><h4>Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat</h4><p>Hellcats have become one of the most talked and must-have wheels in rap over the last few years.</p><p>Nonetheless, Uzi’s wheel has a little more drip than the average.</p><p>After getting this whip at some point in the late 2010s,&nbsp;the rapper got a matte army paint job with all black rims.</p><p>However, about a year later, he upgraded the rims to blade design featured by a bright rose-red color.</p><p>Likewise, in April 2020, the car was repainted with a matte grey.</p><p>Inside of the whip features red LED lights, a Radenso built-in radar, and a JL audio system.</p><p>This starting price for a wide-body car starts at about $55,000.</p><h4>USSV Rhino GX</h4><p>Uzi’s USSV Rhino GX originally started off with yet another army-inspired look, hunter green paint job.</p><p>It was designed back in 2018; however, two years later went through three different upgrades.</p><p>Priced over half a mill, this bulletproof truck is not less than a tank in looks as well as capabilities.</p><p>It includes a battleship grey paint job with orange accents, a charcoal body with a bright pink “16” on the front grill, and lastly, an all-black cover.</p><p>The SUV additionally features a train horn, a PS4, red LED lights on the inside and outside, and seven TVs.</p><h4>Bugatti Veyron</h4><p>Lil Uzi purchased his Bugatti Veyron from legendary undefeated boxer Floyd Money Mayweather as a 25th birthday gift to himself in July of 2019.</p><p>Floyd had already spent over $3.3 million on the vehicle. Nonetheless, Lil Uzi got a deal he could not refuse and took the car home for just over $1.5 million.</p><p>This is probably his most prized possession in terms of cars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lil-uzi-vert-Bugatti.png><p>Apparently, Uzi loves to re-do the paint job of a car.</p><p>This particular car was first coated with orange and grey.</p><p>However, since he loves redoing paint jobs, he eventually reworked with an inspiration that merges the anime cowboy Bebop and the Weeknd’s Starboy cover art.</p><p>And like it was not enough, he re-did his interior featuring lipstick red.</p><h4>Lamborghini Urus</h4><p>This Italian bull was initially painted on a primary military green coat and black rims with the number 16 in the back window. The interior was grey and black.</p><p>After a year, it was redesigned in 2018. Uzi took battleship grey on the body and orange accents to match the rims.</p><p>However, he again re-did the paint job. This tie he took the most colorful design, which was inspired by anime Mobile Police Patlabor before changing it again to Vantablack.</p><p>The SUV from an Italian manufacturer comes at a price tag of $200,000.</p><h4>Audi R8</h4><p>Uzi’s R8 is perhaps the most identifiable car in his collection.</p><p>This sports car cost over $200,000 and was initially wrapped in military green.</p><p>Likewise, the doors featured Kimi ni Todoke-inspired designs and, of course, number 16, which refers to the 1600 block back home in Philly.</p><p>The car came with a twin-turbocharged engine, and other features included Radenso’s built-in radar and red LED lights in the back.</p><p>However, in February 2020, Vert redid the paint job with a purple chrome print outside inspired by anime Sword Art Online.</p><h3>Houses</h3><h4>Bell Canyon, California</h4><p>Lil Uzi Vert is done renting places. Now he has purchased a grand mansion in Bell Canyon, California.</p><p>He used to live in a super contemporary mansion with a market value of $15 million.</p><p>He has purchased a similar kind of estate in California but for a lesser amount. The mansion cost him $4.4 million.</p><p>The mansion is located just one hour drive away from Beverly Hills in an area called Bell Canyon.</p><p>Bell Canyon is located in Eastern Ventura County and is a guard gated that provides seclusion and privacy.</p><p>Uzi’s new mansion was built in 2017 and sits on a sprawling lot of almost one and a half acres offering perfect views of the San Fernando valley and gorgeous hills.</p><p>Uzi’s pad is behind secured gates and up the driveway that goes up the hill.</p><p>The mansion spans over 7,000 square feet of living space over two floors featuring stunning views of city lights and mountains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lil-Uzi-Vert-Masion.jpg><p>There are five bedrooms and five full and five half bathrooms with colored hardwood floors.</p><p>From the outside, it looks like just another multimillionaire’s home, but from the inside, it is unique, just like the rapper himself.</p><p>Similarly, probably the best part of the house is his gourmet kitchen with high-end appliances with plain white countertops and expensive marbles on the island.</p><p>His master suite is as large as a typical New York City apartment and offers a fireplace, massive television, and surrounded by more floor-to-ceiling windows and lounge areas.</p><p>Likewise, his ensuite bath offers a tub, two-person bath place, and closet.</p><p>Furthermore, there is an outdoor kitchen and bar area and a massive swimming pool with a spa which resembles the luxury resort of Vegas.</p><h3>Jewelry</h3><p>Lil Uzi Vert has an intensive jewelry collection like other rappers in the industry.</p><p>However, one of the pieces in his collection makes him stand out among the others.</p><p>Lil Uzi Vert took the most expensive piece of diamond in the jewelry game for hip hop and others otherwise and put it right in the middle of his forehead. And that’s permanent.</p><p>Reportedly, the pink diamond cost him more or less $24 million.</p><p>He saved his money for almost four whole years to buy the diamond which he claimed was 110-11 carats.</p><p>Similarly, he claimed that the diamond cost him more than his house and entire car collection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lil-Uzis-Pink-Diamond.jpg><p>However, we speculate that the math does not quite add up, as mentioned by the rapper.</p><p>He’s earned about $30 million after he became a music star, and that’s pretax.</p><p>So now rest is up to you guys, whether you guys believe it or not.</p><p>Apart from his “$24 million pink diamond,” he also owns numerous other jewelry pieces, including his chain and pendant representing Marlin Manson to pay tribute to his idol.</p><p>The pendant and chain feature more than 16,000 individual diamonds in total and are worth $220,000.</p><p>Likewise, he has another chain and pendant, which even landed him on controversy back in 2017. Other rappers thought it to be demonic because it was an upside-down cross. For that piece alone, he splashed over quarter-million dollars.</p><h3>Sneakers</h3><p>Just like any other rapper in the industry, Lil Uzi owns an extensive collection of sneakers.</p><p>His collection of sneakers include Neymar X Nike, Balenciaga Moto Boots, Air Jordan 1, SF Air Force 1, and Rick Owens Geobaskets.</p><p>These are but just a few of his collections. Apart from these, his collection has numerous other brands, most notably Chanel, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton.</p><h2>Lifestyle and Vacations</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Lil Uzi Vert likes living lavishly with his extravagant collection of whips, houses, and watches.</p><p>He does first-class or charters the whole aircraft if he has to go on a tour and take a vacays.</p><p>Similarly, he loves finer things in his life. He has a collection of bag pack 16, to be more precise, and it’s all from Goyard.</p><p>So what does Uzi keep in his bag pack?</p><p>He carries around a sneaker and socks on his designer bag pack.</p><p>Likewise, he also carries a blanket wherever he travels but not an ordinary one. He loves his designer blanket from Y Project, which costs about $1,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Uzi-Nags.jpg><p>Furthermore, he also carries his cologne with himself from Chanel. Whenever he showers, he puts on AXE deodorant, which he later switched to Old Spice, Michael Jordan, Kenneth Cole, and finally to ACQUA DI GIO.</p><p>Similarly, he loves to eat Little Bites muffins.</p><p>Moreover, Lil also loves plain white T-shirts and obviously from one of the top brands you could imagine. Dolce and Gabbana.</p><h3>Vacations</h3><p>It’s like both pros and cons for the music stars that they have to travel often.</p><p>Pros as if they get to spend time of their life traveling different cities all around the world and cons they just have to keep traveling.</p><p>It depends on how you take it.</p><p>However, Uzi seems to enjoy his travels. He regularly posts his vacays on his social media handle.</p><p>In 2019 he had a trip to Sweden, Finland, and England. All of those in a year and for his shows and concert.</p><p>Apart from these, he has also been to Spain and other European countries.</p><h2>Charity</h2><p>Lil Uzi Vert is quite a giver and does not shy away from making a contribution to society.</p><p>Back in 2019, he bought numerous winter coats and delivered them to kids across North Little Rock in Arkansas.</p><p>The gifts also came with a note reading, “Stay warm and enjoy your new coat.”</p><p>Similarly, Lil Uzi also paid for a college tuition fee of a kid he met in a mall.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Putting aside the fact he is rich and famous now, Lil Uzi has had his share of ups and downs.</p><p>He was accused of being a Satanist by fellow rapper Daylyt, who also mentioned that Uzi worshipped the devil.</p><p>The issue became big when he warned his fans that they were going to hell with him back in July 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lil-Uzi-2021.jpg><p>Likewise, on August 17, he posted demonic imagery to his social media handle and also used terms associated with Satanism like “666”.</p><p>It became so big that his record label took away his Instagram access.</p><p>Spooky?</p><p>Moreover, Lil Uzi was arrested after riding a dirt bike without helmets and headlights on December 8, 2016.</p><p>He was released after paying a $6,500 bond.</p><h2>Unknown Facts About Lil Uzi Vert</h2><ul><li>Lil Uzi’s grandmother gave him his first rap CD.</li><li>He played trumpet in his high school</li><li>Likewise, he is really into anime.</li><li>Li Uzi Vert considers his grandmother his best friend.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Who is Lil Uzi Vert dating 2021?</h3><p>The rapper is dating JT, a.k.a Jatavia Johnson.</p><h3>Did Lil Uzi Vert remove the diamond?</h3><p>Reportedly, Uzi Vert has removed his pink diamond from his forehead.</p><h3>Which is Lil Uzi Vert’s highest-selling album?</h3><p>Eternal Atake.
