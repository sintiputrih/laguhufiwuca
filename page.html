I’m calling them “Gimlets with a Girlfriend” – so go grab your bff and mix these up tonight. Plus, lemon + ginger = “healthy drinking.” A lot has been going on this week so, if it’s alright with you, I’m going to speak in bullet points today.&nbsp;Here are links to&nbsp;some&nbsp;random bits that I found delicious and interesting: – This is crazy, but we’ve…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>A vegan pho recipe has been on my “to make some day” list for a long time. I got the idea from a Vietnamese restaurant just a short walk away from our house. Their mushroom pho is has a richly spiced broth and loads of slurpy noodles. It’s hot, flavorful, and comforting, but it still feels nice and fresh. After enjoying bowls upon bowls of their delicious soup, I’ve finally made my own vegetarian pho recipe to share with all of you. What is Pho? If you’re not familiar with pho (pronounced “fuh”), it’s a Vietnamese noodle soup that features…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Raise your hand if you may have had a little too much chocolate and red wine yesterday while celebrating&nbsp;Valentine’s Day. Suffice it to say, I’m getting a slow start to my week, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;plan to recover&nbsp;by catching up on my vegetable intake over the next few days. Here are a few delicious vegan dinners that are favorites in our house.&nbsp;I hope you love them too!

Tackling a new kitchen project together – even if you mess it up – is always tons of fun. Here are 3 date night ideas… each with a Love & Lemons spin, of course! #1: CREATE A SIGNATURE COCKTAIL prep ahead: 1. Make fancy ice in the shape of&nbsp;hearts&nbsp;or&nbsp;x’s and o’s&nbsp;–&nbsp;how cute?! 2. Think about some fun memories you’ve shared over drinks. It can be as extravagant as the Caipirinhas you sipped on your honeymoon in Rio or…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>If I had to pick a favorite holiday, it would have to be Valentine’s Day. I’ve always loved the day because really, it’s so… simple. The only real rule is that you need to show people you love them. Check back Friday for a date night story&nbsp;about Jack and me, but I’m dedicating this post to the person that made this day&nbsp;my favorite when I was a kid – my mom. Growing up, she always made Valentine’s Day so special for me and my sister. For at least a week leading up to February 14th, we would make crafts with…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>There seems to be a national holiday for every type of food imaginable… I’m usually the last to know until my Instagram feed is chock full of deliciousness for National Chocolate Cake Day (January 27th), National Chocolate Chip Cookie Day (May 15th), and the one I’m most ashamed to have missed, National Taco Day (October 4th). But this month, I’m covering all my bases because February is not only National Chocolate Lovers’ Month, it’s also National Cherry Month. To celebrate, we’ve partnered with the&nbsp;Cherry Marketing Institute to bring you these decadent (no-bake) chocolate tart cherry tartelettes. These start with a…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It sounds silly to say, but the first vegan “dish” I really fell hard for was nachos. It was years ago at&nbsp;Native Foods&nbsp;where the Native Nachos were a revelation to us. They weren’t a snack, they were our dinner late one night. They were piled high with taco “meat,” black beans, cashew cheese (a crazy concept at the time), salsa, and guacamole… we scarfed them down saying (with our mouths full) “how are these vegan?!” I came home with their cookbook and every night later that week, I made nachos. My version here is quite a bit different, but the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If there’s any vegetable that’s under-represented on this blog, it has to be the potato. If&nbsp;you take a glance at our recipe index, you’ll&nbsp;notice that I while I have a&nbsp;mild obsession with&nbsp;sweet potatoes, I often skip over&nbsp;other potato varieties.&nbsp;But I have to tell you, I’m in love with all potato varieties (russets, red, whites, blues, the list goes on…), which are especially great for entertaining. These little pizzas are SO delicious and so so easy.&nbsp;A perfect appetizer to serve this Sunday for the big game. To make these,&nbsp;first seek out some colorful pretty petite potatoes. Ok, just kidding, if you…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>Cauliflower is one mighty veggie – it’s can transform into rice, a creamy dip or queso, and even mashed potatoes! But sometimes, I crave it made simply. This caramelized cauliflower steak recipe is what I make on those days. Golden brown, tender, and savory, these roasted cauliflower steaks have become one of my favorite vegetarian main dishes. They’re not a side salad trying to be a meal, and there’s no fake meat. Who knew a slab of cauliflower could be so satisfying?
