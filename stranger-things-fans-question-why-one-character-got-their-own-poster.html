She simply seemed to be reactionary and didn’t even speak up to defend her son after Jason accused his club of satanic rituals. It is certainly confusing when a more prominent character, Tom Wlaschiha’s Dimitri “Enzo” Antonov, didn’t receive one despite having quite a bit of screentime.</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=114 data-injectable=false>Fans seem to think that the only reason she has her own poster is thanks to the actress having a fantastic agent.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>manmanchuck44’s comment from discussion "Am I the only one confused as to why Karen got her own poster?

Whatever the reason, the artwork looks great and the actress, Cara Buono, is probably thrilled with it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0wNGapaCdomLBqbXNoKpmnpGjwG691J6qraGfo3q4tNhmpqedXZi1or7AnKueql2cvLV506GcoqpdpMSvec%2Boqq2domQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
