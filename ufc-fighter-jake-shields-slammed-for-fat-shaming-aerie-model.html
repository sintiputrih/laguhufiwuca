At any rate, Shields is obviously in tip-top shape, thanks to it basically being his job, and also thanks to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">taking banned substances</a>, allegedly steroids. Nonetheless, he’s a pretty good fighter, earning a record of 33-11.</p><p data-characters=105 data-current-count=105 data-injectable=false>He’s also obviously not shy about expressing how he feels, and this time it has led to heavy blowback.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>It all started when Shields posted a photo of a woman’s body he did not exactly take a liking to, and stated “This b*tch needs a gym membership, not a bikini.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>This bitch needs a gym membership, not a bikini <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2uKfDyzLI6</a></p>— Jake Shields (@jakeshieldsajj) <a href=#>April 12, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>It’s worth noting that Shields likely failed to verify whether the woman already has a gym membership, and if she does, whether it would have prevented him from calling her a “b*tch.”</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>Jake received immediate pushback for his anti-bikini stance. One reply earned 17k likes, and reminded him that the woman would probably not be interested in him anyway.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>https://twitter.com/telareadicculus/status/1646304662952493060?s=61&t=_eIQPFjNUMZBauJNtnylgQ</figure><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false><br>Others just straight up called Jake “pathetic,” which our fact-checkers here at We Got This Covered have verified, though it’s unclear if they were just expressing their opinions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>This woman has literally done nothing to you, and you choose to scold and belittle her because of her body… and ON THE INTERNET, which makes it worse….

He can’t help himself, it’s the fighter in him.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>It’s worth noting that, despite his prizefighting success, he was knocked out four times; one might deduce, especially considering his present rant, that he also got the sense knocked out of him.</p><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>That includes what he likely believes is his “sense of humor,” because, well, there is no actual sense to his humor.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Your Korean mom would refuse to feed you dinner if you came home that fat.</p>— Jake Shields (@jakeshieldsajj) <a href=#>April 13, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Absolutely nothing wrong with this body type, arguably the most common body type for most women.
