TMZ reported that Richard allegedly threw a bag of glass at Quinn, which missed her and hit the pair’s two-year-old son, Christian.</p><p>Richard was <a href=#>arrested for a second time</a> later that day for returning to Quinn’s home, thereby violating the restraining order obtained against him after his initial arrest, law enforcement told the Daily Mail. Richard&nbsp;filed a <a href=#>restraining order request of his own</a> on Tuesday, March 26, claiming that he threw the bag at the wall, not at Quinn, and that the bag contained rags and paper towels, not glass.</p><p>The insider tells Us that Quinn “plans to file for divorce very soon” as “this is not the first time she has seen [Christian] lash out in an angry manner” during their relationship.</p><p>“She has felt unsafe for a while,” the source says. “It has been toxic for several months and Christine has been in distress. … It is going to be a long messy road ahead of them, as they both have restraining orders and are not in agreement on plans with their son.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Selling-Sunset-s-Christine-Quinn-Has-Felt-Unsafe-for-a-While-With-Husband-Christian-Richard-726.jpg><p>In her restraining order request, Christine claimed that Richard “<a href=#>faked a suicide attempt</a> to see if I cared about him” in September 2023.</p><p>“[Christian] became angry at me, questioning why I needed to work, asserting that he was providing for everything,” she alleged in court documents. “That night, in our hotel room, I watched [Christian] pour handfuls of pills [and] appear to shove them into his mouth, with pills flying out of his hands and spilling on the floor, and then tell me he was dying.”</p><p>She continued: “After what felt like an hour of [Christian] apparently falling in and out of consciousness and me being terrified, he suddenly appeared sober again and said, ‘You passed the test, you really do love me.’”</p><p>Elsewhere in the request, Quinn claimed that Richard <a href=#>went on a “rampage”</a> earlier this month when she told him she was dissatisfied with their relationship. She alleged that during the incident, Richard took “dog feces” out of a trash can, threw it at her and urinated on the floor.</p><p>Despite the tumult in Christine’s marriage, a second source told Us that the reality star was “in great spirits” at the Xerjoff perfume launch party on Wednesday, March 27.</p><p>“She was all smiles and was happily taking several photos for photographers. She seemed unbothered and was in a great mood all night mingling and taking selfies with guests,” the insider shared. “Christine put on a brave face and was smiling and laughing throughout the night.”</p><p>The source added that Quinn’s former Selling Sunset costars <strong>Nicole Young</strong> and <strong>Davina Potratz</strong> “were there to support her” at the event. (Quinn left the show after season 5 in 2022.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“She seemed really happy to see them both and hang out with them. Both of them gave Christine a long hug and they looked like they were being supportive towards her,” the insider said.</p><p>Quinn and Richard tied the knot in December 2019 after less than one year of dating.</p><p>If you or someone you know are experiencing domestic violence, please call the <a href=# rel=noopener>National Domestic Violence Hotline </a>at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewLW1zZ5kqq2Zo7tutMCsZJ%2BdnKl6trrSmp2eZZakv26tjLCfoqSVYsSqwMdmn66rkpa7pXnCoamiq6Serq97</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
