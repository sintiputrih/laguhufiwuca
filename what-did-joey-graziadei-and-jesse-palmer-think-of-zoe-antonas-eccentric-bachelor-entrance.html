Other women, like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kayla Rodgers</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lauren Hollinger</a>, had a slightly different approach.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=786 data-injectable=true>One of the most infamous entrances of the evening came from a 24-year-old artist from Atlanta, Georgia&nbsp;named Zoe Antona, who unveiled a tray of bananas cut into different sizes in front of Joey. Implying that these bananas were something of the NSFW variety, she asked him, “Which one would you say you resonate with?” Joey followed this rather raunchy question up by selecting a medium-sized piece.</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>Because of this, Bachelor fans got a much more intimate look at Joey than they may have been expecting on premiere night. But what did the Bachelor and host Jesse Palmer think of this unexpected gesture?</p><h2 id=h-how-bout-them-bananas data-injectable=false>How ’bout them bananas?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Bachelor-Zoe.png><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>In an exclusive interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, reporter Kristen Baldwin asked the Bachelor himself about Zoe Antona’s eccentric limo entrance, saying, “There were a lot of interesting limo exits, but I need to know how you felt about Zoe’s entrance, when she essentially asked you to compare your manhood to different pieces of banana? It was quite bold.”</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>Joey sang like a bird in response, admitting that a tray of bananas was not on the night’s bingo card.</p><p>“That was one that I didn’t expect. She put me in a little bit of a tough spot with that one. I went with the modest answer, and I tried my best not to make it any more than me picking up the banana and throwing it in the bush and saying, ‘I look forward to seeing you inside.’ That’s one that I have to remember my family’s watching when I do that kind of stuff.”</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>While Graziadei did not seem particularly amused by the Georgia native’s actions, Palmer had an entirely different reaction. When asked the same question in a separate <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">EW</a> interview, he couldn’t help but admire Zoe’s ability to be so bold, especially on night one.</p><p>“The eternal night-one arrival question: Play it safe or take a chance to stand out?&nbsp;A record number of women showed up to the mansion on night one to meet Joey, so good for Zoe for shooting her shot!&nbsp;I was personally disappointed though that there wasn’t a Beef Wellington on that tray.”</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>Whether you loved it or didn’t, there’s no denying that this limo entrance was one of the most memorable of the night. That said, it sadly wasn’t enough to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">earn the 24-year-old a rose</a> at the first Rose Ceremony of the season.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=false>While we’re devastated that we won’t be seeing more of Zoe’s antics anytime soon, we are curious to know who steals Joey’s heart in the end. To get that much closer to finding out, you can catch new episodes of the beloved competition series every Monday night on ABC, or stream the next day on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJ2hlGK3sLHYZp6rmaqerqWxyGaYp5xdn7K0v8Rmp5qknZq%2FbsDHoqWkZZ%2Bberu7xGaYp6yfo660ecScmp6mpKe2pHnBmpqhnZykv26xza2pmqaTmnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
