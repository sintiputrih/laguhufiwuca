When Cocker was seven years old, his DJ and actor father, Mac Cocker, moved away from the family and settled in Sydney.</p><p>Cocker and his sister Saskia did not hear from Mac Cocker again until Jarvis was in his thirties. Both of the children were raised by their mother, Christine Connolly, when their father left the family; she eventually served as a Conservative councilor.</p><p>Cocker attributes his interest in the opinions and thoughts of women to his upbringing, which was nearly entirely spent in the company of women. In 1998, Cocker and his sister traveled; he penned a song (“A Little Soul” on This Is Hardcore) about being abandoned by his father and briefly working as a butler.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51ktq%2B%2FyJ2cZqKRp8Oqv4ycppyjlad6qbvUrJxmr5iav6Z5w6icrGWalr%2B3tdJmmqibm5q%2FbrjIr5xo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
