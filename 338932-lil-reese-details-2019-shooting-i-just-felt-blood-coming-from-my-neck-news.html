"When I got shot and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I realized I got shot</a>, I got out the car. Looking around, tryin' to see where they at. Wasn't nobody around, so I just got in the car that was behind me and just told them to take me to the hospital."
