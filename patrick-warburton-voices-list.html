However, both live-action and voice acting present their own challenges.</p><p>"It needs to be bigger as we're in the animation realm as opposed to live action," he said of voice acting before adding, "[With] voice-over work you're in a studio by yourself almost always ... kind of like a cold, isolated room. You gotta work your ass up and [get] juiced up."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Patrick's voices list includes Buzz Lightyear, so what does he think of Chris Evans' 'Lightyear'?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney/Pixar Animation Studios</span></figure><p>Along with Tim Allen, Patrick also voiced the Toy Story character — in the animated series Buzz Lightyear of Star Command — before <a href=#>Chris Evans took over,</a> and he is a fan of the newest iteration of the character.</p><p>"From what I've seen from [Chris'] Buzz is he brings a great voice," he shared. "These are characters that are going to live on forever." He also explained how it's each artist's duty to interpret the character the way they see fit.</p><p>The same could be said for his role of Lemony Snicket, which he says A Series of Unfortunate Events executive producer and director Barry Sonnenfeld and Daniel Handler "went to bat" for him for.</p><p>Patrick says he was "fortunate" to work several times with Sonnenfeld, whom he calls a "force" and "an incredible creator."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>"Oftentimes in this industry, they seem to lack imagination," he said. "When I did A Series of Unfortunate Events ... Barry and [Daniel] wanted me to do it. They went to bat for me."</p><p>And we can see why. The series currently has a 94 percent Rotten Tomatoes score, with many outlets praising his performance, demonstrating that Sonnenfeld and Handler's vote of confidence in the actor was warranted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa61vsicomavkaevtr7TqKVmrp%2BesKa%2FjKWgrKw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
