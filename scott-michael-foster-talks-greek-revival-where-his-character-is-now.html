“I have my [own] opinion.

I think he’s probably operating a fish taco stand in Baja, California somewhere, selling tacos and hanging out by a beautiful beach,” Foster, 38, exclusively told Us Weekly while promoting his upcoming Netflix film, Choose Love, in an interview conducted <a href=#>prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>After taking a beat, Foster quickly added: “And somewhere, hopefully, with [his girlfriend] Casey.”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Foster starred on the ABC Family series from 2007 to 2011 as John Paul “Cappie” Jones, the lovable president of Kappa Tau fraternity with major Peter Pan syndrome. The comedy-drama focused on sorority and fraternity life <a href=#>on the fictional campus of Cyprus-Rhodes University</a>, but Foster believes the show’s success stemmed from breaking down the stereotypes that come along with Greek life.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“A lot of times college shows sort of focus on the stereotypical partying aspect, the drinking and the hookup culture and it was so much more than that,” he told Us. “[Greek] was really about who you are between the ages of 18 and 22 and the growth that happens, <a href=#>the change that happens</a>, the friendships that are built. It was more than just, you’re partying. That’s an easy trap to fall in. I think we just were smart enough to avoid that.”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Foster’s character arguably experienced some of the most growth throughout the series, majorly in part to his will-they-won’t-they romance with girlfriend Casey (<a href=#><strong>Spencer Grammer</strong></a>). While the show introduces them as exes, viewers follow them throughout the four seasons as they find their way back to one another — and cement themselves as one of TV’s most iconic couples.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Casey and Cappie end their story driving off into the sunset, but fans have often wondered where their characters — along with the rest of the Cyprus-Rhodes gang — would be today.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>In 2016, Freeform <a href=#>announced plans to debut a Greek: The Reunion movie</a>. The two-hour film would have gathered together the cast for their five-year reunion — but the network decided not to move forward with the film. Foster, however, is still ready to reprise his role if the time comes.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“There was talk a few years ago about a feature [film]. I know that ended up not happening, but I think I can speak for most of us from the cast [when I say] that we had a good script come along and they were willing to do it,” he said. “I <a href=#>think a lot of us would entertain the idea</a> as long [as it] honors the original story. I think we’d all be very happy with it.”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Whether the cast will reconvene on screen remains to be seen, but Foster looks back on his time with Greek fondly — and credits the series for helping craft him into the actor he is today.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Scott-Michael-Foster-Is-More-Than-Willing-to-Return-for-a-Greek-Revival-%E2%80%94-And-Knows-Exactly-Where-His-Character-Would-Be-Now-4.png><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Greek was those early days, right? So I was still trying to figure out who I was as a person, much less what I learned as an actor,” he explained. “And that role [of Cappie] was pivotal in shaping how I approached [my] future characters. He was written very smart, very funny and very witty. So I think that really helped me bring that into future auditions and roles. I definitely think that was such a good role for me to start off with because it helped me embrace that side, which I might not have embraced before.”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Foster has brought those lessons to his latest work, the upcoming romantic comedy Choose Love. The actor portrays Paul, the steady boyfriend of Cami (<a href=#><strong>Laura Marano</strong></a>) who must choose between him and two former flames. The Netflix film, which features an interactive feature and multiple endings, introduces Paul as the “dream” guy — but Foster insists there’s more to the character than meets the eye.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“There’s layers to him,” he told Us. “He’s definitely more than just what he says on paper. He loves Cami and wants to be with her but there are always problems. I don’t know how much I can say, but let’s say he’s definitely more complex than the log might say.”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Choose Love premieres on Netflix Thursday, August 31.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqcp6Speq61wqGYnqRdm7y0wMSrZK2ZnKDAbrPRnpykZaKaw6rCwKVksKCVp7JutMisZJygkaeupMDEq2Siq12jvLh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
