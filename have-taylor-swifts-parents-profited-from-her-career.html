Similarly, anyone who becomes associated with Swift gets analyzed by her fans, including her boyfriends, and her parents.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Has Forbes Reported About Taylor Swift's Fortune</a> as of November 2023?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Taylor Swift is worth $1.1 billion</strong></li><li><strong>Taylor Swift became a billionaire in October 2023</strong></li><li><strong>Taylor Swift has made $500 million from royalties and touring</strong></li><li><strong>Taylor Swift's music catalog is worth $500 million</strong></li><li><strong>Taylor Swift owns $125 million in real estate</strong></li></ul><p>Even though Swift's fans want to know about her parents, the fact is that a lot of information about them remains secret. A perfect example of that is the fact that most of Swift's fans don't know the truth about her parent's finances these days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anytime new information about Swift's finances comes to light, the media loves to report on it. Despite that, aside from people who know Swift personally, nobody knows if her parents are on her payroll and if so, for how much.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-s-15-most-popular-songs-spotify-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's 15 Most Popular Songs, Ranked (According To Spotify)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's top Spotify streams will likely be changing since she announced her new album, 'The Tortured Poets Department' will be released soon.</span><p>Even though it is unclear if Taylor Swift has a business relationship with her parents, some aspects of their financial links have been reported. As a result, it can definitively be stated that Taylor Swift's parents have made money from her career if those reports are accurate.</p><p>According to a 2011 Daily Mail report, Taylor Swift's parents arguably benefited from their daughter's career in a big way that year. The reason for that is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift reportedly bought her parents two incredible homes</a> in 2011. While Swift's parents didn't get money deposited into their accounts, gaining millions in real estate was a huge boon to their net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ttweb_taylor-swift-prefers-when-paparazzi-just-do-their-job-_bk_a1.jpg><p>"She is probably the most generous daughter in the world. Just four months after shelling out $1.4million on a new home for her parents Taylor Swift has dished out a further $2.5million on a new mansion. The country singer, aged just 21-years-old has bought the prime piece of real estate in a very exclusive area in Nashville. Her parents Andrea Gardner and Scott Kingsley Swift will be the newest residents in the area and will become neighbours to the likes of Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban."</p><p>At face value, it is pretty easy to argue that Swift's parents made money from her career based on those home purchases. That said, it could be argued that since Swift's parents didn't directly get money from Swift's career as a part of those purchases, that doesn't count.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/all-of-taylor-swift-s-famous-exes-ranked-by-how-much-fans-loved-them-together-3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>All Of Taylor Swift's Famous Exes, Ranked By How Much Fans Loved Them Together</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has dated celebrities like Harry Styles, John Mayer and Calvin Harris, and her fans have plenty of thoughts about each relationship.</span><p>For anyone who feels that way, there was another situation in which one of Swift's parents got a lot of money from her career. That said, it is worth noting that in this case, it appears like the parent involved didn't know they were going to cash in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Swift has been in many feuds during her time in the public eye, her animosity against Scooter Braun hit differently.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who has owned Big Machine Records</a> according to Variety?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Big Machine Records</p></td><td><p>Ownership History</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Scott Borchetta</p></td><td><p>Founded in 2005</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Scooter Braun‘s Ithaca Holdings LLC</p></td><td><p>Bought in June 2019</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hybe Corporation</p></td><td><p>Bought in April 2021</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>After Braun's Ithaca Holdings bought the Big Machine Label Group, he became the owner of the masters of Swift's first six albums. When Swift learned about this turn of events, she spoke out about her anger and frustration in no uncertain terms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-06t135942-704.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Swift and her parents are very close, they undoubtedly were there to support their daughter through her battle with Braun. However, as Cinema Blend reported in 2023, Swift's father made a lot of money from Braun's purchase of Big Machine Label Group.</p><p>Before Braun bought the Big Machine Label Group, Swift's father Scott Swift came to own roughly 5% of the company. As a result, when Braun bought the Big Machine Label Group for $330 million, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Swift was paid roughly $15.1 million</a>. When news of this situation went public, Swift's team made it clear that her father had no idea about Braun's purchase until it was finalized.</p><p>When Bruan bought the Big Machine Label Group, he gained the masters of several artists. However, there is absolutely no denying that the Big Machine Label Group's biggest asset was the masters of Swift's first six albums. As a result, Braun certainly wouldn't have paid that much and Scott Swift wouldn't have gotten $15.1 million if it wasn't for his daughter's career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-did-taylor-swift-39-s-parents-sacrifice-for-her>How Much Did Taylor Swift's Parents Sacrifice For Her?</h2><p>Sadly, there are far too many stories of stars having disturbing financial relationships with their parents.

However, if fans look into the history of Swift's relationship with her parents, they don't seem to be an example of disturbing celebrity parents. At least, they aren't that kind of parents unless they have kept a gigantic secret from the world for more than a decade.</p><p>Years before Swift became an international superstar, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her parents were already extremely successful</a>. Scott Swift was a stockbroker-turned-vice-president for Merrill Lynch and her mother was a former marketing manager at an advertising agency.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instead of Swift's parents using her singing talents to get a good life for themselves, the opposite reportedly happened. Swift's parents used their own money to help their daughter make her dreams a reality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/are_taylor_swift_s_parents_on_speaking_terms__720.jpg><p>According to a People profile about Swift's parents, they even uprooted and moved their entire family to just outside Nashville to help their daughter. People went on to describe how big of a deal this move would have been for Scott Swift's career. "Scott moved the financial advisory business where'd he worked for nearly three decades — The Swift Group, under Merrill Lynch — to their new home."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, as Swift's mother once explained to Entertainment Weekly, they tried to make sure their daughter didn't feel pressured by the move.</p><p>"I never wanted to make that move about her 'making it.
