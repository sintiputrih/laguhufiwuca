It is crucial to recognize that anyone can create a certificate, and there is a risk of fraudulent certificates circulating. Some contemporary artists' foundations have even stopped issuing certificates due to legal complications.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Certificates of Authenticity are imperfect indicators of an artwork's value, but they can be useful when combined with other data. Appraisers and insurance underwriters in the art world consider CoAs as just one piece of evidence and rely more heavily on materials like catalogues and provenance documentation. CoAs are not foolproof, and their value lies in their ability to be linked to the artwork in an unchangeable way.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>To combat the challenges of fraudulent certificates, new technologies are being developed. Companies like Tagsmart utilize DNA tagging and blockchain to record the history of artworks, providing a more secure method of authentication.

A renowned artist or reputable art dealer is more likely to provide genuine artwork with proper documentation.
