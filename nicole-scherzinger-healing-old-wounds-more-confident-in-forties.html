I get to go home and I'm also an adopted Brit, so I get to bring the hill from here to the hill over there and be the first official artist to do this concert for Wimbledon on the hills. So I think it's super prestigious, but also going to be really fun.</p><p id=esKSvmzceF3k data-wc=43>"I just want everybody to have a good time, that's what it's all about and it's a celebration of this beautiful tradition of Wimbledon, and it's about connecting people across the pond and bringing us all together.
