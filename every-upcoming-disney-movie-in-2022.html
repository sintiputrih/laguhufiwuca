The year also featured critically acclaimed movies from Disney affiliates making bids for the award season, such as <a href=#>Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch</a>, The Eyes of Tammy Faye, Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story, and Guillermo del Toro’s Nightmare Alley.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Upcoming Live-Action Disney Princess (& Who Plays Them)</a></span></p><p>Since the world is still experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, there are many films that Disney originally intended to release in 2022 that have been delayed. The Marvels and Indiana Jones 5, two of Disney’s most exciting upcoming films, were formerly slated for 2022 premieres before being pushed back to 2023. Nonetheless, here’s every future Disney movie&nbsp;that is currently scheduled to release in 2022.</p><h2>Deep Water – March 18</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p><a href=#>Deep Water</a> is an erotic psychological thriller directed by Fatal Attraction’s Adrain Lyne, which stars Ben Affleck and&nbsp;<a href=#>No Time to Die</a><a href=#>‘s&nbsp;</a><a href=#>Ana de Armas</a>. The movie follows married couple Vic and Melinda Van Allen who have fallen out of love with each other. The two begin partaking in twisted and deadly mind games against one another while realizing those around them are dying. Deep Water also features performances from actors like Tracy Letts, Rachel Blanchard, Jacob Elordi, Finn Wittrock, and Lil Rel Howery. The&nbsp;film is being produced by New Regency and distributed by 20th Century Studios (both properties of Disney) and was originally set to release in theaters on January 14, but has now been pushed back to March 18, 2022.</p><h2>Cheaper By The Dozen – March 18</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>One of several <a href=#>new movies coming to Disney+ in March 2022</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Cheaper By The Dozen</a> will once again remake the classic comedy premise. Zach Braff and Gabrielle Union star as Paul and Zoe Baker, the parents of ten kids in total, as they navigate the chaos of raising an enormous (and very rambunctious family). Set to release on March 18,&nbsp;Cheaper By The Dozen will be available exclusively on Disney+.</p><h2>Better Nate Than Never – April 1</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Another Disney+ original movie,&nbsp;<a href=#>Better Nate Than Ever</a> will premiere exclusively on the streaming service on April 1, 2022. It follows the story of aspiring actor and part-time seventh-grader Nate Foster, who dreams of performing on Broadway like his Aunt Heidi (played by Lisa Kudrow, known for starring as <a href=#>Phoebe on the show&nbsp;Friends</a>).&nbsp;Better Nate Than Ever promises to be a heartwarming and inspiring ride full of good laughs and even better musical numbers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Disney’s Upcoming Movie Releases – From 2021 to 2025</a></span></p><h2>Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness – May 6</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>The long-awaited MCU installment, <a href=#>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a>, serves as the sequel to Doctor Strange (2016) and follows Dr. Steven Strange’s research on the Time Stone being interrupted by a friend-turned-enemy. The film follows the events of Avengers: Endgame, WandaVision, Loki season 1, and Spider-Man: No Way Home for the MCU’s Phase 4 timeline. The Benedict Cumberbatch film will be released in theaters on May 6, 2022.</p><h2>Chip ‘n’ Dale: Rescue Rangers – May 20</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>In the spirit of rebooting classic properties, Disney will also release a new&nbsp;Chip ‘n’ Dale movie in 2022.&nbsp;C<a href=#>hip ‘n’ Dale: Rescue Rangers</a> follows the iconic chipmunk duo 30 years after their heyday of stardom, as they must once again team up for an adventure. A <a href=#>spiritual successor to&nbsp;Who Framed Roger Rabbit </a>with a&nbsp;blend of live-action, 2D animation, and even CGI,&nbsp;Chip ‘n’ Dale: Rescue Rangers should be a fun ride. It’s set to premiere exclusively on Disney+ on May 20, 2022.</p><h2>The Bob’s Burgers Movie – May 27</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Following the first 12 seasons of Fox’s long-running animated series <a href=#>Bob’s Burgers</a>, the comedy show is finally getting its first movie treatment. The movie will be a musical comedy, following the Belcher family while supposedly giving answers to long-held mysteries of the series. The animated Bob’s Burgers Movie will premiere exclusively in theaters on May 27, 2022.</p><h2>Lightyear – June 17</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>After several movies and short films, the Toy Story franchise is finally introducing a stand-alone film that doesn’t directly follow the original characters. While controversy abounded about <a href=#>Chris Evans voicing Buzz Lightyear instead of Tim Allen</a>, they’re actually not the same character. Evans’ Buzz is the Toy Story universe’s human version of the character that inspired Allen’s toy Buzz. <a href=#>Lightyear</a> serves as the movie that Andy would have gone to see in theaters before getting the toy, following the origin of Buzz Lightyear as an accomplished space ranger. Pixar’s Lightyear is set to debut in theaters on June 17, 2022.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Movie Releasing In 2022</a></span></p><h2>Thor: Love And Thunder – July 8</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Taika Waititi is returning to the MCU to direct the sequel to 2017’s Thor: Ragnarok, now following the Asgardian god after the events of Avengers: Endgame and Loki season 1. The plot of <a href=#>Thor: Love and Thunder</a> is so far unknown, but if it takes place in the timeline after No Way Home and Multiverse of Madness, Thor will be dealing with the effects of time and space manipulations. Aside from Chris Hemsworth, previous MCU and <a href=#>Thor actors like Natalie Portman</a>, Tessa Thompson, Jeff Goldblum, and Chris Pratt will return for Thor: Love and Thunder. The MCU Phase 4 movie is scheduled to be theatrically released on July 8, 2022.</p><h2>Untitled David O. Russell Film – November 4</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Director David O. Russell is scheduled to have a new film release on November 4, 2022. The project is so far untitled, with the only plot synopsis for the period film stating that “a doctor and a lawyer form an unlikely partnership.” Without many details on the actual events of the future Disney movie, Russell’s movie already has an all-star cast lined up, including big names like Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, John David Washington, Robert de Niro, Taylor Swift, Zoe Saldana, and Anya Taylor-Joy.</p><h2>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever – November 11</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>The long-awaited sequel to 2018’s Black Panther is finally reaching theaters on November 11, 2022.
