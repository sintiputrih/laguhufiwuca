million.</p><p>Steel, who is &nbsp;<span style=font-weight:400>76</span> years old, has built a fortune through her popular romance books.</p><p>The fact that she is also <strong>the world’s fourth best-selling fiction novelist</strong> explains everything on its own about her impressive wealth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/8c35f500c2f6f4f588075fd0f0eac651-danielle-steel-book-authors.jpg><p>She has successfully gained the 58th spot on America’s Self Made Woman 2020.</p><p>Undoubtedly, she makes $62.24 million per year, making her income $5.19 million per month.</p><p>Danielle Steel is one of the most published women of all time, with a massive body of work to her name.</p><h2>Danielle Steel&nbsp;Lifestyle & Vacations</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Steel has a great sense of routine. She arrives at her office at sharp 8:30 a.m.</p><p>She takes one piece of toast for breakfast and an iced decaf coffee in the morning.</p><p>Later on, she snacks on tiny bittersweet chocolate bars after lunch and throughout the day.</p><p>Steel works on each book for two to three years, juggling many projects at the same time.</p><p>Similarly, she works on her novels for lengthy periods of time, frequently for 20 to 30 hours at a time on her typewriter.</p><p>She watches approximately an hour of television, usually Netflix, on the rare nights she finishes work earlier than expected.</p><p>By the way, Richard Madden, the star of Bodyguard, is her new favorite, and she describes him as “very cute.”</p><h3>Vacations</h3><p>Now, as time went by, she sits and thinks whether she had overworked herself and lost all the fun.</p><p>Hence to overcome that guilt now every summer, she spends a week in the south of <strong>France</strong> with her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/f69c9d51b690b73918d89abb8db2515b.jpg><p>Her family members hang out on the beach while she reads.</p><p>In fact, in one of her blogs, she has written that she is grateful that her children are still willing to spend their vacations with her despite their chaotic schedules.</p><p>Nevertheless, she hopes they will do the same for many years to come as this is the only excuse for a family to reunite except Christmas.</p><h2>Danielle Steel: Houses, Cars</h2><h3>Houses</h3><p>Being the super-rich she is, Danielle has the <strong>Spreckels Mansion in San Francisco</strong>, which has 55 rooms.</p><p>As per estimation, if the Spreckles mansion ever went on the market, it may be for $50 million or more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/spreckels-mansion-danielle-steeles-home.jpg><p>She also has a lavish property in <strong>Paris,</strong> which apparently once owned by Prince.</p><p>Well, that’s pretty obvious that a wealthy personality with those love-filled writing skills definitely would have a home in the city of love Paris. We can probably assume maybe for inspiration or simply as her desire.</p><p>Moving on, Danielle listed her almost 3,500 square foot <strong>Stinson Beach, California, house</strong> for $8.995 million in August 2014.</p><p>In November of that year, the 4-bedroom, completely furnished property sold for $8 million.</p><p>Previously, Steel sold another 3,000-square-foot Stinson Beach home for $2.579 million in 2012.</p><p>As per reports, that was a significant discount from the $6.5 million she paid for it in 2002.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>In the first place, there is no such information spoon-fed to us via the internet about her lavish motors.</p><p>Second, except that Steel has plenty of parking, with enough for about 8 automobiles outside and at least another 5 in the garage.</p><p>What a bummer! We can only assume and imagine what electric car does she actually drives among those.</p><h2>Danielle Steel Movies, Investments, Endorsements & Book Publications</h2><h3>Movies</h3><p>More than 20 of Steel’s novels have been turned into television movies, including</p><ul><li><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Crossings</a> (1982)</li><li><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Once in a Lifetime</a>

company that creates and markets the scent.</p><p>In addition, Steel owned and operated a modern <strong>art gallery in San Francisco</strong> for four years.</p><p>Thus, she still keeps looking for new pieces to add to her collection.</p><h3>Book Publications</h3><p>Although this whole article is about one of the all-time great novelists and authors, it is obvious there would be books mentioned everywhere.</p><p>Still here are some of her best of best books which readers must read once in their life.</p><li class=TrT0Xe><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Summer’s End</a> (1979)</li><li
