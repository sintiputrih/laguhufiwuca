Colton’s initial suit alleged unpaid legal fees and a breach of contract from Punk thanks to the lawsuit against WWE physician Doctor Chris Amann after Punk’s 2014 appearance on the Colt Cabana podcast Art of Wrestling.</p><p>In the counter-suit, Punk alleges that he spent $1.2 million on legal bills over the two years, and that Cabana did not contribute anything toward attorney fees or other expenses. The lawsuit also touches on how popular the CM Punk episode of Are of Wrestling was, essentially alleging that despite the money made from the episode, nothing was ever put forward in their legal defense.</p><p>According to the initial lawsuit, Cabana alleges that Punk reportedly promised to cover him financial during the Amann lawsuit, but later hired his own attorney following a falling out between the two. Since then, Cabana has been trying to recoup the money he claims was lost, and it seems as if this will continue to be dragged through the courts as the situation escalates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBpbmxwYWKwrnnPrqWkZZaeuaa%2FjJymrqakmr9uv9Siq2aZl5a2r7%2FTZpqopKRisKKuwKeY</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
