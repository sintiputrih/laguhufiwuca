But I just didn’t want to do anything about it, really. I felt like my wine and my pasta and biscuits and crackers and cheese were getting me through.”</p><p><strong>Gwyneth</strong> was able to lose weight with the help of <strong>Dr. Will Cole</strong>, who put her on a bone broth diet and plan that he created for her. She has since lost 11 pounds.</p><p>“I remember when I started this intuitive fasting program Jan. 3. I thought, all I could think about was, ‘When can I have a cocktail again?’” <strong>Gwyneth</strong> said (via <a href=#>Yahoo</a>). “You know me, I don’t cheat, I don’t break, I’m so disciplined and I was like, I can’t do this. Then I started to feel so good after about 60 days in.”</p><p>She continued, “And now I’m starting to feel so good that I’m like, yeah, like, I would drink if I could, maybe, but not seven days a week anymore. I don’t want to go back to that.”</p><p><strong>Gwyneth</strong> also <a href=#>recently opened up about her husband’s struggles with COVID-19</a> and the symptom that lasted for nine months.</p><p><span>Just Jared on Facebook</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6ton6euu6bAx2anmqSkp7y4edGerZ6ZnKh6qbvWZqSum5hixKa1xqGrZquYmnqorcinnJ1lmaN6ssHAq5inrJmjsm68y66qZqCfrHq0tMRmo6irpGK2tXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
