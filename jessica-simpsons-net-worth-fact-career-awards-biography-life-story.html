It all started when 37-years old Natalie Portman quoted Jessica Simpson in her recent interview with USA Today. Portman has been keeping herself busy making interviews promoting her new film, “Vox Lux”. Portman quoted that Jessica’s bikini photo featured on the cover of a magazine with a title, “I’m a virgin” got her confused during her teen. This resulted in the contradiction among them.&nbsp;</p><p>Jessica has calmly responded to Natalie via a photo shared on her Instagram and Twitter accounts saying,&nbsp;</p><p>“@Natalieportman- I was disappointed this morning when I read that I “confused” you by wearing a bikini in a published photo taken of me when I was still a virgin in 1999. As public figures, we both know our image is not totally in our control at all times, and that the industry we work in often tries to define us and box us in. However, I was taught to be myself and honor the different ways all women express themselves, which is why I believed then- and I believe now- that being sexy in a bikini and being proud of my body is not synonymous with having sex. I have always embraced being a role model for all women to let them know that they can look however they want, wear whatever they want and have sex or not have sex with whomever they want. The power lies within us as individuals. I have made it my practice to not shame other women for their choices. In this era of Time’s Up and all the great work you have done for women, I encourage you to do the same.”</p><p>Natalie Portman apologized in a classy way, ” I completely agree with you that a woman should be allowed to dress however she likes and behave however she likes and not be judged, I only meant to say I was confused — as a girl coming of age in the public eye around the same time — by the media’s mixed messages about how girls and women were supposed to behave. I didn’t mean to scare you and I’m sorry for any hurt my words may have caused. I have nothing but respect for your talent and your voice that you use to encourage and empower women all over the globe.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=best-known-for></span>Best Known For<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li style=text-align:justify>Her role in The 2003 reality television series, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica, with her then-husband, Nick Lachey.</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-of-jessica-simpson></span>Early Life of Jessica&nbsp; Simpson<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The full name of Jessica Simpson is Jessica Ann Simpson.
