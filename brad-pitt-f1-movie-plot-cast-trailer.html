"We've got Brad and Damson actually driving the cars, which is pretty spectacular in itself, but to do that in front of a live audience and at the speeds they're doing it and figuring out a way to capture it…The logistics of it are unlike anything I've done before," he said.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a3c8344cf31d-gettyimages-1038519102.jpg><p id=epgcnL58NizR data-wc=39>"We're shooting at the actual Grands Prix, there are certain aspects of this film where we're working in very, very tight windows, shooting on the track, between practice and qualifying sessions, in front of hundreds of thousands of people."</p><p id=ezKhjAZdqfY4 data-wc=47>Joseph added that producer Lewis Hamilton has been "invaluable" to the cast and crew. "He's the first person I contacted three years ago. I knew for us to make it as authentic as possible, someone on the team who lives it day-in and day-out would be invaluable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eb8d3b0d033b-lewis-hamilton-miami-grand-prix.jpg><p id=ewW7f00yUb7J data-wc=55>"Lewis has been an incredible partner; he jumps on Zooms with me between races to go through the script, line by line, turn by turn, you know, tire compound by tire compound, to make sure that we are getting all the details right. Beyond that, on a creative and story level, he also has input."&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>What is the budget for F1?</h2><p id=eHWPduIqm5S data-wc=30>Following the SAG-AFTRA strikes in 2023, it was widely reported that the budget for F1 had ballooned to $300 million but according to producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, this isn't the case.&nbsp;</p><p id=evj9olsQ5zf data-wc=58>"It's completely, unfortunately, tens of millions of dollars out of whack in the wrong direction, and in the right direction for us," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Deadline</a>. "What people don't realize is, first of all, we're shooting in rebate [locations], England has a big rebate, lots of Europe has rebates and so does Abu Dhabi. It all lowers the budget.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/51f246fa316e-jerry-bruckheimer-silverstone.jpg><p id=eLq3yKLxRPI data-wc=36>"Plus, we've raised more money for our car [through sponsorship] than some Formula 1 teams. You take that all into consideration and it really drops that number quite a bit lower than what people would think."</p><p id=e49vqc-i9R3 data-wc=31>Asked what the actual budget is, Jerry explained that as it's "Apple's money" he was unable to give a number, the producer noted that it was lower than fans might think.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
