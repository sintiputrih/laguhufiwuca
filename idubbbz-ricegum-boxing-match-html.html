In his recent YouTube video, the YouTuber revealed how Ricegum hid from him after initially pursuing him for a boxing match. 
iDubbbz, also known as Ian W. or Ian Carter, said that the fellow YouTuber called him out first for a fight through his videos in 2018. But since Carter claimed he wasn't following Ricegum on social media, he got to know about the challenge a bit later."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But since Carter claimed he wasn't&nbsp;following Ricegum on social media, he got to know about the challenge a bit later. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"Fast forward to present day, June 2021...Ricegum reaches out to my wife, my precious wife, and you know what he says," the social media star said in the video, unveiling a text message that&nbsp;Ricegum sent to his wife,&nbsp;Anisa Jomha.</p><p>The text message read, "Yo tell idubz to fight me. He fell off."</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He then said that he agreed to have the boxing match after having a long discussion with his wife. He explained Ricegum even handed over all the responsibility, including organizing the event and speaking with boxing organizers and managers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>iDubbbz also underwent laser eye surgery so that he didn't have to fight with eye lens, which could be a bad option to go with during a fight.</p><p>But after finalizing everything, when he tried to contact&nbsp;Ricegum, iDubbbz claimed Ricegum ghosted him and the event organizers. He further revealed that when&nbsp;he eventually replied, he made various excuses to avoid the fight.</p><p>"Oh! My neck is sore. He is talking about how it is not enough money. He wants like a million plus dollars," he said, recalling the things Ricegum told him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Carter bashed&nbsp;Ricegum, real name Bryan Quang Le, for hiding and making stupid reasons, as he said the fellow YouTuber was a loser with zero boxing experience. Additionally, he noted Ricegum was not even famous for claiming such an outrageous amount for a charity boxing match.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He further revealed,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Ricegum was going to earn more than anyone else [from the match], okay. I am not taking a salary on this boxing event. My earnings are going to pay all the other fighters and for charity. So&nbsp;Ricegum would be earning the most, hands down. Yet, he still whipping out.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;Ricegum also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">released a statement</a> via&nbsp;Drama Alert's KEEMSTAR, where he claimed he was not interested in boxing with&nbsp;iDubbbz. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I thought iDubbbz would grow up and be more mature, but he's on the same childish energy, still making YouTube videos," he said in the statement.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>In the wake of the hour,&nbsp;iDubbbz — in the previous video —&nbsp;invited other fighters to join the&nbsp;charity boxing event. He even named&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Dr. Disrespect</a> for his list of content creators he'd be willing to fight while joking he would "break his little scrawny legs in half."</p><p>Dr. Disrespect later read out the invitation aloud after one of his live audiences made him aware of the open boxing challenge. But in response, he said, "Who?" implying he was&nbsp;unaware of who iDubbbz was.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Besides, iDubbbz has given out his email address in the video's description, asking to email him if they are&nbsp;influencers and wanted to get involved in the&nbsp;charity boxing event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKGUqq%2BjrtlmqaKblZzCrnnBqK%2BippdiuqLAwqFloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
