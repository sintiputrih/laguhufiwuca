One way to maintain that isolation, it seems North Korea has learned, is by controlling access to the Internet.</p><p>By most estimates, less than a tenth of a percent of North Korea’s population is allowed to use the Internet (for comparison’s sake, approximately 80% of the United States population regularly uses the Internet, and the average person spends two hours per day online). But that’s far from the strangest part.</p><p>These 27 facts and images reveal just how strange the Internet is inside North Korea:</p><img alt="North Korea Internet" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/north-korea-internet.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>For starters, the vast majority of North Koreans don't have the internet; they have intranet.

However, purchasing a computer in North Korea requires government permission and, on average, about three months' salary. Thus, very few citizens actually own a computer and use Kwangmyong.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Computers Library" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/computers-library.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>For those who do, Kwangmyong features between 1,000 and 5,500 "websites," that are mostly state-run news services, academic resources, and sites belonging to government agencies.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span> <img alt="North Korea Websites List" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/north-korea-websites-list.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body><a href=#>North Korea Tech</a>, a relatively small but widely cited website, maintains a list (above, now likely somewhat out of date) of all the websites based in North Korea.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>North Korea Tech</a></span> <img alt="North Korea Browser" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/north-korea-browser.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Among all of Kwangmyong's sites, ABC News estimates that on average North Koreans will regularly visit just 10-15 "government-blessed" sites.

Estimates suggest that, out of the country's 25 million people, perhaps just a few thousand have full Internet access, including political leaders (like Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un, both standing, dressed in tan, above), students at the top universities, and government employees engaged in cyber warfare.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span> <img alt="Ip Address Totals" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ip-address-totals.jpg> <span class=caption-body>In fact, North Korea has just 1,024 IP addresses.

Although China and North Korea have maintained relatively good relations, there are extraordinary differences between these two adjacent nations (see their border above, with China on the left and North Korea on the right).</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span> <img alt="Russian Embassy North Korea" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/russian-embassy-north-korea.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Amid such strict Internet limitations, some North Koreans have taken creative measures to access the Internet. The government noticed that there was an unusually high clustering of residents living near foreign embassies and correctly surmised that this was because citizens were hopping on those embassies' Internet connections. Wi-Fi has since been banned at all foreign embassies (see Russia's embassy in North Korea above).</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="North Korea Phone Bike" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/north-korea-phone-bike.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Elsewhere, reports show that North Koreans living near the Chinese border have been able to illegally connect to Chinese networks in order to get online via their mobile devices.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="North Korea Cell Phones" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/north-korea-cell-phones.jpg> <span class=caption-body>There are about 2 million mobile phones in use in North Korea, but citizens are restricted from using them to access the Internet.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Samjiyon Tablet" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/samjiyon-tablet.jpg> <span class=caption-body>While North Koreans have recently been able to use tablets -- largely one model presumed to be manufactured in China (Samjiyon, above) -- they too are not equipped with Internet access.
