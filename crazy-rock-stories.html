This Chicago artist and self-proclaimed "recovering groupie" is responsible for creating plaster molds of the penises of more than 50 rock stars since the 1960s.</span><span class=credit>Mick Hutson/Redferns/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Jimi Hendrix</h2><span class=caption-body>By all accounts, Jimi Hendrix was Cynthia Plaster Caster's first subject.

He admittedly began shooting up again "almost immediately."</span><span class=credit>Larry Marano/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Keith Richards</h2><span class=caption-body>Keith Richards claimed that he once snorted the ashes of his deceased father.

He then led police on a car chase from the scene before being arrested and serving three years at South Carolina’s State Park Correctional Center.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Ace Frehley</h2><span class=caption-body>Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley once allegedly chugged perfume in a drunken stupor. According to bandmate Paul Stanley, Frehley was already intoxicated during a limo ride and purposely drank the entire bottle of perfume after learning that it contained alcohol. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Rick James</h2><span class=caption-body>Funk pioneer Rick James was arrested in 1991 for torturing a woman while high on crack cocaine.

The Cenotaph is located in the Alamo Plaza, a spot adjacent to the famous landmark.</span><span class=credit>Shelby County</span><h2 class=title>Marilyn Manson</h2><span class=caption-body>In 1998, shock rocker Marilyn Manson did more than $25,000 worth of destruction to a room at a Sheraton Hotel in New York after a concert at the Poughkeepsie Civic Center.

I've had problems with the police."</p><p>These immortal words sum up the view that so many rock stars have held: The only problem with living hard is getting caught. For stars like Richards, drugs, booze, and an endless parade of lovers were just part of the lifestyle. In fact, the rock gods of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s in particular seemed to be in a contest to see who could take things the farthest.</p><p>If The Rolling Stones got <a href=# rel=noopener>kinky with a groupie and a candy bar</a>, then Led Zeppelin was going to raise the stakes and <a href=# rel=noopener>incorporate a shark</a>. If the bad boys of Mötley Crüe were rumored to be snorting multiple lines of cocaine, then Ozzy Osbourne felt the pressure to inhale a line of ants.&nbsp;</p><p>From guns and groupies to trashing hotels and defiling American landmarks, these crazy stories from rock music history are prime examples of how wild things could get once the amplifiers were turned off for the night. And while these tales of rock star excess may seem too bombastic and barbarian to be true, they most certainly did happen and multiple first-person recollections — as well as more than a few police reports — can prove it.</p><p>Check out the gallery above and buckle up for the craziest stories in rock history.</p><p>After reading these larger-than-life rock tales, have a look at&nbsp;<a href=#>rock's most popular songs with not-so-innocent lyrics</a> or dive into tales of the <a href=#>legendary groupies</a> who changed music history.
