Today, it is located in the Eskihisar village in Turkey’s Mugla Province.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-467503 alt="Digging Out The Dancing Muses" width=800 height=999 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/digging-out-the-dancing-moses.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-467503 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Stratonikeia ve Lagina Kazısı / X</span><span class=caption-body>Researchers digging the “Dancing Muses” statue out of the ground.</span></p><p>Archaeologists found this rare sculpture inside a frigidarium — or cold bath — in the Roman baths of Stratonikeia. Unfortunately, the statue wasn’t in perfect condition. While most of the statue is intact, including its body and base, its head and arms are still missing.</p><p>Philiskos hailed from Rhodes, a major center for artistic innovation during his time, and records indicate that he mostly created heroes and gods from ancient mythology. The “Dancing Muses” was said to depict one of the muses born from the union of Zeus and Mnemosyne. Philiskos is believed to have sculpted, in total, nine sculptures of the muses.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-467500 alt="Archaeologists Cleaning Dancing Muses Statue" width=900 height=677 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/archaeologists-cleaining-dancing-moses-statue.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-467500 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Stratonikeia ve Lagina Kazısı / X</span><span class=caption-body>Archaeologists cleaning off the uncovered “Dancing Muses” statue.</span></p><p>Little information is known about Philiskos, however, as up until now it was believed that none of his original sculptures had survived. Rather, historians have had to rely on written records and references by other artists to understand the true extent of Philiskos’ influence on the ancient art world.</p><p>Previously, a replica of his original “Dancing Muses” was discovered in another Roman bath in the city of Perge, and another in Rhodes, indicating just how widespread these replicas were. Finding the original sculpture by Philiskos, however, offers a true glimpse at his technique and influence.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-467502 alt="Dancing Muses Statue" width=700 height=933 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/dancing-moses-statue.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-467502 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Stratonikeia ve Lagina Kazısı / X</span><span class=caption-body>The recovered “Dancing Muses” statue, missing its arms and head.</span></p><p>The Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced that the statue will be exhibited at the Muğla Museum after restoration work on the statue has finished.</p><p>After reading about this newly discovered statue, read about the <a href=#>enormous statue of a man holding his penis</a> that was also recovered in Turkey.
