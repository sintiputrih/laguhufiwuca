Everyone knows who they are and the general gist of things, but some details are essential when it comes to how it kickstarted West's hot new love affair with Censori.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/untitled-design-42.jpg><p>According to E! Online, Kardashian filed for divorce from West in early 2021. Insider then reported that West was being asked to pay $200,000 for child support, which began a series of West privately and publicly asking for her to come back.</p><p>According to People, Kardashian would rebound with comedian Pete Davidson, while West initially rebounded with model Irina Shayk. The bigger news from that was how angry West was with Davidson, which started one of the biggest one-sided beefs in celebrity history. According to Insider, West privately and publicly mocked Davidson, even claiming that the Staten Island native looked like a "troll".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Tall Is Kanye West Compared To 9 Other Famous Rappers?</a></span></p><p><a href=#>West has been banned from Australia before</a>, so while the public may not have sided with him during this beef, it isn't the first time he's done something really controversial.</p><p>West and Davidson's odd yet public beef has been the source of attention when it comes to West's non-music life.

Here's how their relationship with Davidson differs from theirs with Censori.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-real-reason-why-north-_nori_-west-is-not-allowed-to-operate-her-instagram-handle-on-her-own.jpg><p>There has been little information regarding Censori's relationship with West's children, but what has been released has been pretty telling.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Nicki Swift</a>, North was not very welcoming of Censori at first. She was loyal to her mom and did not want anyone else to take her place. She was also confused and hurt by her dad’s sudden marriage and his controversial statements about her mom and their family. She was reluctant to meet Bianca and did not warm up to her easily.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bianca-censori-has-a-mysterious-relationship-with-kanye-west-and-kim-kardashian-s-kids-here-the-truth-about-it.jpg><p>According to The Source, Saint was more curious and carefree about Bianca. He liked her creativity and wanted to learn more about her work as a designer, something he shares with his dad regarding his focus on art and expression. He was also impressed by her Australian accent and "wanted to visit her country someday".</p><p>The two younger West-Kardashian children are too young to understand what's going on, but it appears they get along well with Censori. There seems to be no drama at all when it comes to Censori's relationships with her new husband's kids, which is something all parties involved should be and are happy about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiimqapmnq4sdKtZKedp2LEqrLEZpmimZ6Yrm6vxKeqqKqZYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnWoquhZZueum63wKubmquYnq6vv4ycn6KklKeyr3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
