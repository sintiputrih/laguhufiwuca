She leaves behind a skeleton crew of working Royals, which currently appears to be fronted by Jeffrey Epstein’s best bud, the perma-smirking Prince Andrew. Yay.</p><h2 id=h-time-to-jet data-injectable=false>Time to jet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1161265361.jpg><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>There’s no official word from Camilla on why now specifically is the best time to get the heck out of dodge, but her departure does fill in a few blanks in the Royal jigsaw. For one, we can at least surmise that Charles is not about to die. That dampens the persistent rumors that the Palace’s refusal to confirm the type of cancer Charles is a subtle indication the situation is more serious than they have let on.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>For example, if Charles was suffering from pancreatic cancer (as the gossip mill insists) he may have had just weeks to live. So, the fact that Camilla feels able to leave him to vacay on her own means he’s not at Death’s door. Now, Charles may be on Death’s street or making a three-point turn into Death’s driveway, but it doesn’t seem like he’s going upstairs right away.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>All that said, taking a solo tropical vacation while your significant other is undergoing cancer treatment is a bit sus. It’s safe to say this has been noted by the British public, many of whom will have personal experience with exactly this kind of situation:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I hope Queen Camilla enjoys her holiday…</p><p>There are people up and down the country whose family members are being treated for cancer that are working full time & also taking unpaid time to support them at appointments, not getting on a private jet and going on fkn holiday</p>— Sue (@suetthatsme) <a href=#>March 4, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>But hey, we don’t have to smile before the world’s press while standing shoulder to shoulder with the repellent Prince Andrew, so we’re prepared to cut Camilla a little slack.</p><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>Camilla beating a hasty retreat to somewhere more sunny and pleasant than London in March may also give us some vaguer clues on the William and Kate situation. Presumably, the inner core of Royals know precisely what’s going on with the pair, so we can be relatively certain there won’t be any bombshell announcements this week confirming that she’s in a coma or that William is in danger of being dragged away in handcuffs.</p><h2 id=h-reading-the-leaves data-injectable=false>Reading the leaves</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2045770592.jpg><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>But while Camilla’s vacation may indicate that reports of behind-the-scenes drama are exaggerated, this hasn’t stopped conspiracies from growing. For example, reports have pointed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">£80 million in Royal jewelry going missing</a>, some of which were in Camilla’s possession.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>Could this somehow be linked to the mysterious death of Thomas Kingston? Can we read into the apparent sight of bruises on William’s neck? Has Camilla hot-footed it out of the country with diamond rings duct-taped to her thighs to start a new life as Queen of the international criminal underworld?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Now apparently €80m in royal jewels is missing and Camilla is going on vacation alone? <a href=#>https://t.co/eI61D0c4fO</a></p>— The Adventures of Angry Jesus and Teeth Doll (@JesusAndTeeth) <a href=#>March 4, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>Probably not, but in the realms of wild Royal fanfiction Camilla pulling a Saltburn-style caper on the Windsors and making a swift Lord Lucan-style exit as the flames rise behind her private jet is at least fun to imagine. If this dream were true I just hope she got to put on ‘Murder on the Dancefloor’ and throw some triumphant shapes around Balmoral before packing her bags and calling an Uber to the airport.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>Whatever the real reasons for Camilla’s vacation, and whatever it tells us about the internal dynamics of this odd family, we can at least say it’s looking like something of a PR nightmare. Anyone abandoning their cancer-stricken spouse for a luxurious solo tropical break would be met with raised eyebrows, let alone when you’re leaving the King of England alone for his treatment.</p><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, we imagine that the Royal courtiers are walking around some very quiet gilded corridors as the staterooms collect dust. Queen Elizabeth famously said the Royals “have to be seen to be believed”, and with so many ducking out of the spotlight, we have to wonder how long it’ll be before people start asking if spending millions of pounds on this dysfunctional and secretive soap opera is good value for money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SwornIpaOaZZqawbR5zq6rZqeWYsGpsYyuZKRlkaOxbq%2FLrpysZaWoeqq6jKilZqyYmnq1vtStn2anlmKwqa3RpZysZZOWu6Sx0WaZmqykobJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
