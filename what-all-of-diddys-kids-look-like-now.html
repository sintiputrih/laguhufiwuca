He told Power 105.1's <a href=#>The Breakfast Club</a>&nbsp;that he was very proud of his current crop of kids, and he revealed that he was shooting for double figures. "I love children," he said. "I'm trying to get to 10! It's a race!" When host Charlamagne tha God asked if he was serious about wanting to add another four kids to the Combs clan, Diddy replied that he "could go to eight without a problem."</p><p>Pressed further, the hip-hop mastermind confirmed that, while he's open to adding more than one kid to the family, he only sees room for one more mother. "Whatever is supposed to happen in the future is going to happen, but that's something that I want," he said. "I would only have it with my girl, of course." According to <a href=#>GlobalGrind</a>, Cassie first appeared on Diddy's radar in 2007 when he heard her debut single "Me and U" in the club. Before long she was signed to Bad Boy and, while they kept their courtship secret for a number of years, today they make little effort to hide it.</p><p>We wonder how Diddy's kids feel about the possibility of their family expanding even more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamplboR6e9ahmK1lkaG5brvFZpuinJSuwG63yJ2qZqSfpLhuuMiknGamn6x8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
