The next month, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star <a href=#>continued to fuel rumors</a> when she was seen picking up the athlete from the Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles. A source later told Us Weekly exclusively that the duo wasn’t ready to<a href=#> put a label on their relationship</a> just yet.</p><p>“They’re hooking up, but they’re not serious,” the insider said in June. “She’s talking to a couple different guys. She has so many men after her it’s crazy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kendall-Jenner-Has-Flirty-Instagram-Exchange-With-NBA-Star-Devin-Booker-002.jpg><p>Before being linked to Booker, Jenner previously dated basketball stars <a href=#><strong>Blake Griffin</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ben Simmons</strong></a>. When a TikTok user joked about “NBA players passing around” the reality TV personality, she<a href=#> shut down the negativity</a> with the perfect NSFW response.</p><p>“They act like i’m not in full control of where i throw this cooch,” she <a href=#>tweeted</a> in April.</p><p>Jenner’s rumored romance with Booker comes shortly after she reconciled with Simmons, 24, who she began dating in May 2018. The former pair was <a href=#>last seen together in February</a>, but a source told Us at the time that they were “not officially back together.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They both like <a href=#>having a no-strings-attached type of relationship</a> with each other, for the most part,” the source explained. “They both work and travel frequently and don’t find it very realistic to be in an exclusive relationship with one another. They do really like each other though and love spending time together.”</p><p>Despite the ups and downs she’s experienced in her love life, Jenner views her relationships as <a href=#>an opportunity to “learn different lessons.”</a></p><p>“A lot of the relationships have taught me more about myself, which is the most valuable,” she said in a behind-the-scenes video for a Calvin Klein campaign in February.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZ6Zrq24jKOcp6aVp3qosdOsZJ%2BkmafBunnOp2SipqOprqi%2BwKZksKGknXqvrsBmqq2ZomKxpsLIp2Sbp5%2BgsrN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
