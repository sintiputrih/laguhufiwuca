On Wednesday (March 29), the two women shared a warm embrace at an event in New York City as Teyana Taylor looked on. While it’s unclear what the event was for — though Revolt suggested it was to celebrate Taylor’s latest film, A Thousand and One — it’s the video of the “Girl on Fire” singer and the “Lip Gloss” rapper-turned-actor that sent social media into a tizzy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Lil Mama was, apparently, so moved by the performance that she hopped onstage to serve as the unofficial hypeman — even as Hov’s wife, <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>, unsuccessfully tried to stop her from becoming a Twitter trending topic by repeatedly yanking her arm.</p><p>Despite Lil Mama becoming the punchline of many jokes afterwards, Keys told The Morning Hustle in October 2021 that <a class=underline-link href=#>she wasn’t even aware of the rapper’s presence</a>.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Listen, to this day, I truly never knew she was even on the stage — that’s the craziest part of the whole thing for me,” she said. “I was on that stage, [JAY-Z] was in the middle, she was on the other side of Jay, and I never saw her.”</p><p>Keys understood where Lil Mama was coming from as a fellow New Yorker and joked that her music tends to have that effect on listeners.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/03/swizz-beatz-gifts-alicia-keys-mercedes-maybach-designed-by-virgil-abloh-250x142.png alt="Swizz Beatz Gifts Alicia Keys Mercedes-Maybach Designed By Virgil Abloh" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Swizz Beatz Gifts Alicia Keys Mercedes-Maybach Designed By Virgil Abloh</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>March 27, 2023</p></a><p>“That was wild to me,” Keys admitted. “She’s from New York, too. I think she really felt the energy of the record and she loved it and she couldn’t hold herself back. Look, this is what my music does to people.

Don’t do that… That’s our sister. Man, we love her. I wouldn’t recommend people just jumping on other artists’ stages.</p><p>“She’s a New Yorker… She got excited. Things happen.
