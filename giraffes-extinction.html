The giraffe population in sub-Saharan Africa has seen a sharp 40% drop in the past 30 years, largely caused by American tourists “trophy hunting.”
With just 97,500 of the world’s tallest animal remaining, conservationists are insisting the U.S. government officially classify giraffes as endangered in order to prevent their “silent extinction."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now, officials are shocked to realize that there are actually fewer giraffes than elephants roaming the African plains.</p><p>“When I was doing research on giraffes in Kenya a few years ago, they were quite abundant and no one questioned that they were doing well,” Jeff Flocken, the North America regional director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, told the <a href=#>Guardian</a>. “Only recently have we looked at them critically and seen this huge drop, which has been a shock to the conservation community. This is an iconic animal and it’s in deep trouble.”</p><p>The refocus on protecting the graceful, long-necked creatures has been triggered, in part, by the images of trophy hunters and their prey spreading through the Internet.</p><p>In August, a photo of a 12-year-old hunter Aryanna Gourdin holding up the slumped head of a dead giraffe caused a social media firestorm.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-112316 alt="Giraffe Poaching" width=750 height=704 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/giraffe-hunt.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-112316 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>12-year-old Aryanna Gourdin and the giraffe she killed on a trip to Africa.</span></p><p>While the image horrified many environmentalists, other Americans applauded Gourdin’s hobby. She has since amassed over 50,000 social media followers.</p><p>“Although there are flaws in the current system, (poachers posing as ethical hunters for example), trophy hunting remains the only effective way to obtain money for conservation efforts,” she <a href=#>argued</a> in response to the backlash.</p><p>Regardless of the motivation behind the hunts, environmentalists feel that government regulation is necessary.</p><p>“Currently, no US or international law protects giraffes against overexploitation for trade,” Masha Kalinina, a Humane Society specialist, <a href=#>said</a>. “It is clearly time to change this. As the largest importer of trophies in the world, the role of the United States in the decline of this species is undeniable, and we must do our part to protect these animals.”</p><p>Five groups joined together to file a <a href=#>legal petition</a> with the US Fish and Wildlife Service this week to grant giraffes the endangered classification. The federal organization now has 90 days to respond — though the process of granting status can take longer than a year.</p><p>After learning about the threats that could lead to the extinction of giraffes, read about <a href=#>the infamous lion killer who fell 100 feet to his death during hunt</a>.
