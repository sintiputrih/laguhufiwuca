A former Frito-Lay plant janitor who long took credit for inventing Flamin’ Hot Cheetos has been peddling an “urban legend,” an explosive report said Sunday.
Richard Montañez has repeatedly claimed that he pitched the idea of the chili-covered Cheeto to an executive while working as a custodian at Frito-Lay’s plant in Rancho Cucamonga, California,the Los Angeles Times reported.
The story garnered him lucrative speaking engagements, a forthcoming biopic directed by Eva Longoria and even a book deal for his memoir titled, “Flamin’ Hot: The Incredible True Story of One Man’s Rise from Janitor to Top Executive."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
