And while many expected Theron to reprise the role at some point, <a href=#>Miller ended up casting Anya Taylor-Joy instead</a> after confirming that a prequel was happening.</p><h2 id=charlize-theron-once-said-she-was-willing-to-return-for-a-prequel>Charlize Theron Once Said She Was Willing To Return For A Prequel</h2><p>As rough as the situation was on set with co-star Tom Hardy when Theron worked on Fury Road, the actress was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">still determined to return</a> should Miller ever revisit her character.</p><p>“I’d love to,” Theron confirmed while promoting Atomic Blonde in 2017.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How 'Furiosa' Star Anya Taylor-Joy Made Her First Million</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later on, the actress also admitted that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wanted a sort of do-over</a>. “Because I never really truly appreciated or respected George Miller’s vision until I saw [the completed film and] went, ‘Oh my God, this is what was in his head the whole time and I couldn’t hear it,’” Theron said.</p><p>“And so it’s the one movie where I go, ‘If I had another opportunity, I’d get a little bit more of what he tried to do in the first one.’”</p><h2 id=george-miller-thought-he-could-reunite-with-charlize-theron-on-the-prequel-lsquo-for-the-longest-time-rsquo>George Miller Thought He Could Reunite With Charlize Theron On The Prequel ‘For The Longest Time’</h2><p>The truth is Miller had been toying with the idea of doing a prequel since he started work on Fury Road. That film took over a decade to realize, after all, and that gave Miller and co-writer Nick Lathouris time to work on character backstories, including Furiosa’s. But it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">originally just meant to be a backstory</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It was purely a way of helping Charlize and explaining it to ourselves,” Miller even said.</p><p>But then, Furiosa’s story was so interesting that he went ahead with a second screenplay. And when Miller did that, he initially thought that he could get Theron again.</p><p>“For the longest time, I thought we could just use CG de-aging on Charlize, but I don’t think we’re nearly there yet,” Miller revealed.</p><p>“Despite the valiant attempts on The Irishman, I think there’s still an uncanny valley. Everyone is on the verge of solving it, particular Japanese video-game designers, but there’s still a pretty wide valley, I believe.”</p><h2 id=he-cast-anya-taylor-joy-after-auditioning-with-a-line-from-the-network>He Cast Anya Taylor-Joy After Auditioning With A Line From The Network</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the end, Miller found Taylor-Joy after one simple, but compelling audition where she delivered the “I’m as hell” speech from The Network.</p><p>“Apart from the brilliance of the writing, it’s a piece that can be done to camera. It doesn’t need an acting partner,” Miller told Empire Magazine. “Anya did one version, which was really good.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why WB Didn't Want Charlize Theron To Play Furiosa In 'Mad Max: Fury Road'</a></span></p><p>With a single audition, Taylor-Joy also convinced Miller that she’d be perfect for a younger Furiosa.</p><p>“Then I gave her just a couple of simple notes about intention and she just absolutely nailed [it]. I think it was done on an iPhone. I sent it to the studio. I explained why I thought she was right for the role,” he continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I said I was really happy to talk about it but it was so persuasive that we didn’t need to talk. The studio said, ‘Tick.’” Taylor-Joy has since wrapped up her time on Furiosa.</p><h2 id=charlize-theron-is-okay-with-anya-taylor-joy-not-reaching-out-after-getting-cast>Charlize Theron Is Okay With Anya Taylor-Joy Not Reaching Out After Getting Cast</h2><p>As for Theron, she’s moved to various other projects. The actress is also happy that Furiosa is happening and that Taylor-Joy will take over her role.</p><p>“Listen, I’m not mad about [Miller doing a prequel instead of a sequel],” she said. “One of the greatest f****** actresses [Anya Taylor-Joy] is picking up something that I only imagined.”</p><p>Theron also understands why Taylor-Joy hasn’t reached out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s always tricky. Who wants to pick up the phone and say, like, ‘Hey, we’re going to go do this without you,’” Theron said.</p><p>“No one wants to do that. So, I totally get that. And I love George. I know I’ll talk to him again. I think it was just too hard.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Charlize Theron Doesn't Think She's As Famous As Kim Kardashian, Calls Her Fame 'A Mediocre Ride'</a></span></p><p>And while the two A-listers are yet to speak to each other, Taylor-Joy looks forward to chatting with Theron soon.</p><p>“Charlize was sweet enough — I think both of us ended up in a situation where we were both so respectful of each other that we didn't want to reach out prior [to filming],” the actress recently told People.</p><p>“The second it was over, once this press tour is over, we're having dinner and we're going to swap war stories for sure.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since finishing her work on the film, Taylor-Joy also has nothing but praise for the franchise and the upcoming movie.</p><p>“It is an entirely unique situation and I only finished it 13 days ago and was then thrown into this circus, so I think it's going to take me a second to understand what's going on. But I feel really grateful to be here and I feel so grateful that I got to work with the unbelievable creatives that man Furiosa,” the actress said.</p><p>“The Mad Max world is entirely unique and epic at a scale that I can't even [describe].”</p><p>Furiosa is set for release on May 24, 2024.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dmLWivsuisZ5lpJ2ys7vNZpinnF2Wu7qtjK2YsqSfp3qru9hmnauhlaOxtHnMmptmpZGterG%2BxKqsnqRf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
