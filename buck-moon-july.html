The big question is though, how will it impact your Zodiac sign specifically and what the hell actually is a ‘Buck’ Moon?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Read on to find out my <a href=#>celestially</a> curious people…</p><h2>What actually is the Buck Moon in Capricorn?</h2><p>As you probably already know from checking out the night sky, the moon has different phases, with the biggest and brightest phase being the full moon. You can find out more about the <a href=#>moon phases in their entirety here</a>.</p><p>“According to Vedic astrology, the Full Moon in Capricorn on 3 July will fill you with strength, confidence in victory, and courage. The main goal is to manage this supply of energy properly,” Olga Ramora, founder of <a data-offer-url=https://moonly.app/ class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://moonly.app/"}' href=# rel=noopener>Moonly app</a>, says.</p><p>“Jupiter, the ruler of Sagittarius, continues being in conjunction with Rahu and forming a new 12-year cycle. It is important to take as much energy from the Full Moon period of 2-4 July, as you can put into action.”</p><p>Olga explains that all of this excess energy can manifest itself in “blind optimism, recklessness, conflicts at home, and hassle”, which is why it's important to monitor expressions of selfishness and arrogance during a Full Buck Moon in Capricorn, and to make sure you are a team player and maintain harmless relationships with others.</p><p>“Self-aware individuals can set their affairs up for success, receive support from others, find answers to important inner questions, and better formulate their new and renewed worldview - all of which is favoured by the Full Moon in Capricorn and the position of other planets,” she adds.</p><p>“Your behaviour and energy can change depending on the pull of the moon. It's exactly the same with the tide, the tide rises and falls in line with the phases of the <a href=#>moon</a>. Humans are made up of up to 70% water so no wonder the moon affects us,” Zee, physic and founder of <a data-offer-url=https://www.zeetozen.com/ class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.zeetozen.com/"}' href=# rel=noopener>Zee to Zen</a>, says.</p><h2>How will July 2023's Buck Moon impact your zodiac sign?</h2><p>The Buck Moon in Capricorn will impact each <a href=#>Zodiac sign</a> differently, here's exactly what yours has in store for you:</p><p><strong>Aries</strong></p><p>Use that pent-up energy and channel it into your career and you could be about to see a big breakthrough. Show them what you're worth.</p><p><strong>Taurus</strong></p><p>This Buck Moon brings new opportunities, but you'll need to step out of your comfort zone in order to receive them.</p><p><strong>Gemini</strong></p><p>Gemini, this Buck Moon in Capricorn is all about communication for you. You may find that an old friend gets in touch, or you see an existing relationship in a different way. Whatever it is, talk it out.</p><p><strong>Cancer</strong></p><p>While this full moon may be in Capricorn, it falls under the Cancer which means that focus should be on you this month. Take some time to look at your relationships and figure out what it is you really want.</p><p><strong>Leo</strong></p><p>Like Sagittarius, Leo is a fire sign which means you're in for one busy month. Make a list and know what your priorities are and then get stuck in - but be sure to leave time to relax too.</p><p><strong>Virgo</strong></p><p>Your love live may be about to take a turn, Virgo, whether you've just matched with someone new or you're hoping for a big question … love is certainly in the air.</p><p><strong>Libra</strong></p><p>The Buck Moon will bring a change to the usually outgoing Libra. Prepare to be a total homebody this month as you focus on a renovation or get stuck into domestic life.</p><p><strong>Scorpio</strong></p><p>The supermoon brings expansion in the form of a new project, Scorpio, so it's time to get stuck in and reap the rewards.</p><p><strong>Sagittarius</strong></p><p>This is your moon! Enjoy it and make use of. Once a year you get to look around you, take stock, and in the light of this supermoon make some big decisions. This moon in particular will bring some financial shifts, so spend wisely.</p><p><strong>Capricorn</strong></p><p>Capricorn, this supermoon is all about power, so now's the time to make that last push to make that long-held goal a reality.</p><p><strong>Aquarius</strong></p><p>The onslaught of energy from this Buck Moon may make you feel more tired than usual, so be sure to set aside some ‘you’ time for proper rest and relaxation.</p><p><strong>Pisces</strong></p><p>This full moon sees a more social time for you, Pisces, so say ‘yes’ to your invites and open up your calendar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauqp2WtKLGyKecZ5ufY8Kse8Crq6KbnJp8o8HCpGSmp5%2BjeqvBy7I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
