After the game, he told the crowd, “I can’t believe how fast 20 years went by. This is crazy … and to be standing at center court with you guys, my teammates behind me, appreciating the journey that we’ve been on — we’ve been through our ups, been through our downs. I think the most important part is we all stayed together throughout”.</p><h4>More about his retirement</h4><p>Every Laker figure even rewarded tribute to him, adding O’Neal, Phil Jackson, Pau Gasol, Derek Fisher, Lamar Odom, and also Magic Johnson.
