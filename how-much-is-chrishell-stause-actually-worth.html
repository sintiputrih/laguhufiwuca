She told&nbsp;<a href=#>Haute Living</a>&nbsp;that she'd been "paid far less than what I should have" and had "a mentality that I was just grateful to be there." Luckily, she managed to overcome that. She landed a gig on "All My Children" in 2005 and stayed until 2011. <a href=#>Additional acting gigs followed</a>, including stints on "The Young and the Restless" and "Days of Our Lives."</p><p dir=ltr>Chrishell didn't rely solely on acting, though. During "DOOL" downtime, Chrishell started working in real estate. She'd gotten licensed during "All My Children" and decided real estate could be a great second career. As her bio with <a href=#>The Oppenheim Group</a> noted, she also felt it'd help her protect her money and negotiate better. She joined "Selling Sunset," competed on "Dancing with the Stars," and bought herself a <a href=#>fabulous home</a> in Encino, California. She married "This Is Us" star <a href=#>Justin Hartley</a>, but the pair settled their divorce in January 2021, per <a href=#>E! News</a>.</p><p dir=ltr><a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> puts Chrishell's net worth at $5 million, but she's remained frugal. "I'm still really cheap!" she told <a href=#>Page Six</a>, admitting she ends up "doing the most ridiculous things" to save money. She reuses makeup remover pads and learned the hard way bath bombs weren't meant to be partially used. She relied on Marshalls and T.J. Maxx when decorating her new home, telling <a href=#>The Spruce</a>: "I don't care how successful I am. I'm always going to look for a good deal."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlgbYV5e8eormalpZi1brXSZpqhqpmotaa4y2aqrZmlqLJurcKtrJqknK56uLvRrZ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
