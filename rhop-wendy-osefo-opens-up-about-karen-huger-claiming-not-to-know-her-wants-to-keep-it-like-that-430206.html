It makes sense your name is “Karen”🙄🤷🏽‍♀‍ #RHOPWatchParty.’</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CD9HGRQhnBE/</a></p><p>She spoke on the situation further in an interview with ET Online: ‘I have nothing for [or against] Karen. Let her continue to say she doesn’t know me, that’s fine. Because if she knew me, she would know not to mess with me. So, you’re right, you don’t know me. Let’s keep it like that. I’m not a fan of people who go out of their way to be mean to other people. That’s just not my speed. I’m not a mean girl. I don’t like that, and so it’s interesting because how I define a queen is someone who not only oversees their kingdom, but builds their kingdom. And the only way you can build your kingdom is for you to love the people around you, and I just don’t see that happening.’</p><p>She also noted that the most surprising thing about getting to know the ladies of <a href=# title="Candiace Dillard Slams RHOP Co-Star Monique Samuels For ‘Lies And Manipulation’">RHOP</a> is that <a href=#>Huger</a> is not the motherly figure that she makes herself out to be on the show.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about this unexpected feud?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinbyxedaepZ2xXaTAprLOZqapnZ6oera8jJqZqK2kYriivsSnZKGtl5q%2Fbq%2FLmqCmoZ6ceq%2B702arqGWbo7y4eceeqWavkaPBtHnTqGSknZWleqrAjKWgpJ1dqbWiwIxtamlqYGt8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
