It's a visually striking adult animation series developed by <strong>Michael Green</strong> and <strong>Amber Noizumi</strong>, a husband-and-wife team. It is a revenge story. The plot is set in Japan's Edo period and follows a mixed-race swordmaster who lives in disguise while on a vengeance quest. It's not unexpected that Netflix originals like Yasuke and Ominusha have contributed to the top samurai animes of all time.</p><p>The series has already received praise for its treatment of mature subjects, animation, bunraku, and live-action inspirations in its visual style, and a cinematic look and sound that enhances its battle sequences and surroundings. In addition to <strong>George Takei</strong>, <strong>Ming-Na Wen</strong>, <strong>Stephanie Hsu</strong>, <strong>Masi Oka</strong>, <strong>Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa</strong>, <strong>Brenda Song</strong>, <strong>Darren Barnet</strong>, <strong>Randall Park</strong>, <strong>Harry Shum Jr</strong>., and <strong>Mark Dacascos</strong>, the show has an A-list cast of Asian and Asian American voice actors.</p><p>One of the characters is Ringo, who is a loyal and devoted soba maker. Despite his disabilities, Ringo aspires to excel by becoming a great samurai. He also aspires to be the best soba maker in the world. He has an important role in the show, so let us learn more about him.</p><p>Previously, we talked about <a href=#><strong>gay character</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>Seki</strong></a>.</p><h2>Details About Blue Eye Samurai Character Ringo!</h2><p>Blue Eye Samurai is another Netflix anime that revolves around the titular biracial warrior Mizu, who pursues vengeance for her terrible past in Edo-Period Japan and is joined by another <a href=# rel=noopener>character</a>, Ringo, the friendly cook. He is Mizu's <a href=# rel=noopener>faithful cook</a> and has been a constant accomplice since they first met.</p><p>Ringo is a character that was born with no hands. He desires to be a great warrior at first, so when a blue-eyed samurai capable of defeating even Hachi the gunman enters his cafe, he witnesses excellence firsthand.&nbsp;Meanwhile, encountering greatness firsthand in the shape of Mizu teaches him that he can't touch greatness any more than he can consume the sun. He recognizes, however, that he can help greatness, that he can help Mizu. He demonstrates that he is not only useful but also unafraid to disagree with his master when Mizu becomes too consumed by her need for vengeance.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/11/blue-eye-samurai-ringo-3.jpg alt="Ringo is a cook in Blue Eye Samurai. celebsindepth.com" width=1278 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1278px) 100vw, 1278px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong><span>Ringo is a cook in Blue Eye Samurai.<br></span></strong><strong>Source: The Envoy Web</strong></p><p>Mizu tries to push him away, frustrated by his persistence, but the soba maker is no weak stick that can be broken so quickly. He pursues Mizu until the samurai can't help but take him on as an apprentice. <strong>Noizumi </strong>and <strong>Green</strong> explained that a crippled figure like Ringo might have been handled considerably differently during the Edo period than he is in the anime. Noizumi and Green wanted to be able to understand his outsider status without displaying degrees of cruelty that he might've genuinely suffered to the point where it was unpleasant to behold. Noizumi added that they wanted to make sure the audience knew the series was constantly laughing with Ringo, not at him.</p><p>Meanwhile, encountering greatness firsthand in the shape of Mizu teaches him that he can't touch greatness any more than he can consume the sun. He recognizes, however, that he can help greatness, that he can help Mizu. And he doesn't just say it; he ends up assisting Mizu a lot of the time, even saving her life in numerous cases. He proves to be not only useful but also unafraid to disagree with his owner when Mizu becomes too consumed by her need for vengeance.</p><p>When it comes to the hero method of a samurai, Ringo upholds it and expects his master to do the same. When Mizu is in a critical condition during a brutal conflict, his final words of disappointment before resigning ring loudly in her ears. It allows her to gather perspective and retire for a bit in order to spare Taigen's life, rather than allowing herself to be slain in the heat of the vengeance-filled conflict.</p><h2>Mizu Is Played by Well-Known Actor Masi Oka!</h2><p><strong>Masi Oka</strong> plays the character Ringo in Blue Eye Samurai.&nbsp;He is a well-known Japanese actor, producer, and digital effects artist best known for her role as Hiro Nakamura on NBC's Heroes.
