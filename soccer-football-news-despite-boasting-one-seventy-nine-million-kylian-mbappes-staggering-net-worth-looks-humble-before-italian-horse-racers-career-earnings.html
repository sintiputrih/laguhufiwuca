But he was instrumental in<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9> France’s 2-1 win over the Netherlands</a> in their Euro 2024 qualifiers, scoring both goals to guide Le Bleus to victory. However, despite reportedly being worth $179 million, the France international is still behind a prominent horse racer when it comes to net worth.</p><p>Mbappe has scored 220 goals in 269 games for PSG so far in his career. While he has reportedly been having a sluggish start to the new season for PSG, the France international has, however, scored 8 goals in 9 games for the Parisian outfit. But when it comes to his net worth, he’s slightly behind UK-based horse racer Frankie Dettori.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Kylian Mbappe’s net worth eclipsed by horse racer</h2><p>According to figures released by OLBG, horse racer Frankie Dettori has a net worth of a reported $185 million which ranks him in 42nd place amongst the richest jockeys of all time. Since Mbappe is currently worth just over $179 million, Vettori is around $6 million richer than the French superstar and soccer icon, which is rather surprising given the difference in popularity between European soccer and horse racing.</p><p>However, Mbappe is currently only 24 at the moment while Vettori is double the PSG forward’s age at 52. So it’s rather apparent that Mbappe will accrue more earnings as his career progresses. Nevertheless, these figures pale in comparison to Portugal and Al Nassr icon Cristiano Ronaldo. The Al Nassr forward has a net worth of over $500 million, making him one of the richest sportspersons in the world.</p><p>On the other side of the coin, former Arsenal and France midfielder Mathieu Flamini is perhaps the richest ex-soccer player in the world after starting his own biotech company called GFBiochemicals, which he founded in 2010. The 38-year-old Flamini is worth a reported $12 billion making him 20x richer than Cristiano Ronaldo.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Despite 24 Years of Age, Kylian Mbappe Surpasses His $500M Rich Idol Cristiano Ronaldo as He Targets Lionel Messi in Big Feat</p></a><p>But net worth discussions aside, for the French star Kylian Mbappe, his next potential transfer or contract renewal has run into some complications. This is particularly because of a new FIFA ruling that his mother/agent has not adhered to.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Kylian Mbappe faces transfer complication after his mother didn’t qualify for FIFA ruling</h2><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>According to reports,</a> Mbappe’s mother Fayza Lamari, who is also his agent is not on the listed FIFA Agent Platform in the directory of official FIFA agents. Furthermore, Mbappe’s 49-year-old mother cannot represent him or any other soccer player as an agent and she cannot sign contracts or even charge her duly commission fees.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/imago1010567044.jpg><p>Lamari must pass exams to become an official FIFA-listed agent and must get her license by May 2024. Subsequently, should Mbappe secure a move to Real Madrid or to other clubs including Saudi Arabia his mother Lamari would not be able to negotiate contracts. This also holds good for a renewal of his current contract at PSG.</p><p>While Mbappe’s future remains uncertain, he will surely look to finish this season with PSG on a high. But whether the Parisian club can retain their Ligue 1 title and go on a long run in the Champions League remains to be seen.</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Are Lando Norris and PSG Sensation Kylian Mbappé Sharing a Barbers Chair?</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9KompydomKzsLvTm5ilpF2jsri%2FjJ2crKiZqbJurs6aqq2hnpx6sLrEZqqerpWjwbp5zaKlnmWdnrmttc6nZKSxnJ6ur3nMm5ipqJWoerTAwKCenqqZo7RuusStZLCnoqm1brjOqKKsZZiquqO4xGaZnp6fp7JutdOao6KZnmK1sL7SnmSrmZOav7R5wpqpnp2iYrKivs2ipaCrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
