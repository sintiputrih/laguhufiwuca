We knew that he wouldn't be very happy about this, but it seems like this will pose much stronger legal ramifications. Moreover, WSHH took the video down after the music executive hit them with a defamation claim and filed to resolve this in court. In the video below, you can see exchanges between both teams and his inner circle that detail some of the motions, responses, motivations, and refutations. Overall, it looks like we might have <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">another tattletale case</a> on our hands in the hip-hop world.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, given the back-and-forth between these camps and WSHH's prompt removal, this might just be a quick damages settlement. While we can't say for sure, we'd predict that there's enough pull to steer this in a favorable outcome for Wack 100. But he's got so much going on right now that maybe this isn't the headache we see it as; just another bag chase. For example, he's made a lot of claims about another video, but this one is an alleged one of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tory Lanez</a> that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he warned her about potentially ruining her</a>.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-wack-100-moves-against-wshh-for-defamation-they-pull-doc-on-his-alleged-snitching>Wack 100 Moves Against WSHH For Defamation, They Pull Doc On His Alleged Snitching</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, there's no real confirmation or evidence of any of this, so we can only wait for time to tell whether something will come of it. Still, folks likely know that the rap manager has a tendency to speak on others' goings-on just as much as his own. Most recently, he contributed to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">conflicting stories about an altercation</a> between <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Offset</a> and 42 Dugg, with the latter maintaining that the former did not rob him successfully. It seems innocuous, but considering Wack 100's ties in the game, it could always lead to shifting and conflicting loyalties and business partnerships.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, not even personal lives and relationships are safe from this ever-persistent magnifying glass. The California native is also pretty involved in Blueface and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chrisean Rock</a>'s romance (or lack thereof, sometimes), <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">defending his client against the former Baddies star</a>. Surely, this axed WSHH documentary won't discourage him from being so vocal. With that in mind, stick around on HNHH for the latest news and updates on Wack 100.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdna31zgJdmrpqbm2J%2BcXyMnaacrZ2au7Wt0bJknZ2WlrqiwMiopWaqlaK8t7HDZp%2BiqF2dvLF5zZ6urA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
