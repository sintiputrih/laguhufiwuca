The Bachelor is a dating and relationships reality television show in the United States. The television show premiered on ABC on March 25, 2002. Chris Harrison ruled over the show for the first 25 seasons. The Bachelor: The Greatest Seasons – Ever! was the first installment in the original The Bachelor series.</p><p>The Bachelorette, Bachelor Pad, Bachelor in Paradise, Bachelor in Paradise: After Paradise, The Bachelor Winter Games, and The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart were all spin-offs of The Bachelor. The program was renewed for a twenty-sixth season on September 28, 2021, with Jesse Palmer, the season five bachelor, returning to the series as host. On May 13, 2022, ABC renewed the program for a twenty-seventh season.</p><h2>How Old Is Davia Bunch from The Bachelor?</h2><p><strong>Davia Bunch</strong> is 26 years old in 2023. Her parents gave birth to her on March 19, 1997, in South Carolina. Bunch grew up in Charleston, South Carolina, where she spent most of her youth. Davia, on the other hand, has not shared anything about her parents. As a consequence, as of 2023, her parents’ identities and professional lives remain unknown. Furthermore, we don’t know whether any of The Bachelor’s cast members have siblings. Daiva’s mother died of leukemia in 2013, leaving her and her family devastated. Davia won a dancing scholarship and traveled to Russia when her mother died, according to Reality Steve’s podcast.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Davia-Bunch-1.jpg alt="Davia Bunch" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Furthermore, Bunch’s father remarried the same year her mother died.&nbsp;Davia was crowned Miss South Carolina in 2018 after returning to the United States and participating in the Miss America pageant.&nbsp;According to Reality Steve, Cat competed in the same pageant. Yes, she competed against Davia for the title of Miss South Carolina while a student at the University of South Carolina.&nbsp;Cat is from New York, although she spent some time in the Carolinas.</p><h2>Davia Bunch Boyfriend: Who Is The Bachelor Cast Dating?</h2><p><strong>As of 2023, Davia Bunch</strong> is not dating anybody. As a consequence, she is single and looking for the ideal life mate.&nbsp;The South Carolina native is slated to be placed on the American dating and love reality television series The Bachelor in order to find the right life mate.&nbsp;The 27th season of The Bachelor will premiere on January 23, 2023. It will feature a tech executive called Zach Shallcross.</p><p>Zach previously appeared on Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey’s season of The Bachelorette.&nbsp;On September 14, 2022, Variety announced for the first time that Zach was the Bachelor frontrunner. On September 20, 2022, he was publicly unveiled on After The Final Rose. Zach got to meet five of his girlfriends during the After The Final Rose special: Brooklyn Willie, Brianna Thorbourne, Bailey Brown, Cat Wong, and Christina Mandrell.&nbsp;On September 23, 2022, the official Bachelor Facebook page announced 32 potential ladies, including Davia Bunch.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Davia-Bunch-2.jpg alt="Davia Bunch" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Davia Bunch’s Net Worth</h2><p>Davia Bunch’s net worth has not been reported as of 2023. And few people have speculated on her financial worth. So, for the time being, we may say that her net worth is being assessed.&nbsp;Davia’s principal source of income is as a digital marketing manager.&nbsp;In addition, she previously held the title of Miss South Carolina and competed in the 2018 Miss America competition, which added to her net worth.&nbsp;So it’s reasonable to infer Bunch has a sizable net worth and lives a comfortable life with her family.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBusMCvoJplkqq7pLSMn6mopV2ptaZ5wZqaoZ2cpL9uv8SaqqimXWeEcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
