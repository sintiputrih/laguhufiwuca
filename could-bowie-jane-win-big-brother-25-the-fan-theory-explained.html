Now, Bowie Jane has a final three deal with Matt Klotz and Jag Bains, the two strongest players in the game right now, which many believe is her digging her own grave."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Given her lackluster gameplay so far, the responses were just too funny!</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>“The Scramble-Verse,” one user wrote, garnering over 500 upvotes, but that was not the only satirical response riddled within the thread.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=801 data-injectable=true>Another user took it upon themselves to use a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivor</a> reference, as well as things that have been featured throughout Big Brother 25 so far: “She goes into final two fire-making vs Matt, and Matt accidentally Aquamans all over his fire, making her the only remaining Survivor. She wins 4-3 against <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Felicia</a>‘s pocket chicken wing.” Naturally, this comment was also a smash hit, amassing over 200 upvotes.</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false>“They change the rules so you can only vote for people born is Australia,” @SneakySalamder6 shared.</p><p data-characters=70 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>“Everyone in the house self-evicts,” @brianmcnail dished.</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>“The house explodes and she’s out back,” @WitchE1 gushed.</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>It looks like the Big Brother superfans have quite the sense of humor, but is there an actual scenario where Bowie Jane could take home the $750,000 cash prize?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bowie-Jane-1.png><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>While a majority of respondents replied with nothing but jokes, a few users developed a real-life situation where Bowie Jane could be deemed the champion of Big Brother 25. Don’t count her out just yet!</p><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>@howcanilose proposed the first real scenario, explaining that the lawyer-turned-DJs’s best chance at winning would be sitting next to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America Lopez</a> (the girlfriend of juror number two, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cory Wurtenberger</a>) in the end: “She goes to the end with America, Matt will vote for her over America. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cam</a> might say “Eff it – I respect her getting me out.” Did America get Jag out?
