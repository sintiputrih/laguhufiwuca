Her focus in the numerous challenges also helped her to secure victory. All in all, she’s definitely one of the strongest Survivor players we’ve ever seen.</p><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Let’s find out a little bit more about the very capable and focused entrepreneur.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-survivor-45-winner-dee-valladares-and-where-is-she-from data-injectable=false>Who is Survivor 45 winner Dee Valladares, and where is she from?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>Dee Valladares <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">originally hails</a> from Havana, Cuba but she lives in Miami, Florida. Starting on the dominant Reba tribe, she played an excellent social and strategic game, and her name barely came up ever on the chopping block.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>Dee credits her entrepreneurial background as being pivotal in helping her to navigate the game. At 23, she started a business called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WANAROAM</a>, which sells rugged travel backpacks.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>“Starting my business at 23. I’ve learned how to turn an idea into reality, how to navigate hardships when finances were uncertain, and how to become a better business partner.” Having a business partner, she said, helped her to approach things democratically with other people as well as illustrating the importance of healthy communication.</p><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=136 data-injectable=false>Working in sales, she’s adept at finding out the key parts of a message and how to sell a story over just a “product.”</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>Part of what helped her excell in the game as well was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">knowing when to step back</a> and let other people take charge, especially in the beginning of the game.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true>For example, when a boat showed up early to take someone on a journey to potentially get an advantage, she stayed put. That’s because the “beginning stages are so crucial in your game.” She knew that she had to blend in and take it easy, because she didn’t want a target on her back early on.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false>In an interview with the Newsweek <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parting Shot</a> podcast, Dee revealed a bit more about her upbringing and just what kept her going during her lowest moments.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>“I think everybody that goes into Survivor needs a ‘why,'” she said. “After every challenge, any time I was at my lowest, two weeks not eating, just straight up coconuts, I always thought to myself, my dad would like, recycle gum.”</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>Dee explained that when her parents lived in Cuba they were so poor that even gum was considered a scarce resource and not to be simply thrown away, because they “really did not have food. They had a piece of bread to share between the family.”</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>When she was growing up, she said, sometimes the only thing to eat would be a cup of noodles, because that’s all her family could afford. She saw her parents work two jobs to try and make sure all the bills got paid, and she never forgot that type of work ethic.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Newsweek (@newsweek)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>That helped her move forward and not get discouraged, so she could keep her eyes on the prize and continue moving forward.
