Hall and Joyce K. (Hall) Walker, was born on March 22, 1973 in Kilmarnock and died on October 29, 2023. He was born in the United States as the son of Garnet R. Hall and Joyce K. (Hall) Walker. Keith’s parents, brother Randy Hall, Jr., and stepfather Wesley W. Walker, Jr. all died before him.</p><p>His four sons, Brian Hall Jr., Hunter, Logan, and Cameron; his loving brother Todd Hall and his wife Michelle Smith; his devoted fiancée Tina Carbaugh; his nieces Caitlin Crowder (John), Brittany Hall, Blair Hall, and Amanda Teter (Michael Cullen); many aunts and uncles; goddaughter Katherine Benson; neighbor Linda Walker; and ” Keith was a self-taught carpenter who, with his future wife Tina Carbaugh,</p><p>built their own company from the ground up. He was attentive and kind, and more often than not, he was willing to serve others rather than make a large financial gain. He hunted with bows, shotguns, and rifles with zeal, and he just recently began coaching T-ball in his spare time. Nobody ever caught Keith when he wasn’t smiling or laughing. He leaves a vacuum in the community that will never be filled, as well as in the hearts of his family,</p><p>friends, and acquaintances. A memorial service will be held at the Currie Funeral Home in Kilmarnock on November 8th at 11 a.m. Friends and family are invited to attend the Currie Funeral Home on Tuesday evening, November 7th, from 6 to 8 PM.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwrtGimKdlmJa5rXnOm6CtrZGnxm66wKyfr6GcobJuwM1mmauhkaN6qa3LpWShmaNisaqxw2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
