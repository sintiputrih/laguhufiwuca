The former Disney star added a collection with a white crewneck that reads “<a class=link href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>I’m a Motha</a>” for $45, and a T-shirt that reads “<a class=link href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>I’m Stevie to the bulls–</a>” for $30.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>On Wednesday, Darius, who <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed son</a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Leodis Andrelton Jackson</strong></a> with Keke on Saturday, Feb. 25. retweeted a video of the star at the Usher concert and made a seemingly disparaging comment about her wardrobe. He wrote, “It’s the outfit though… you’re a mother.” Later, he reiterated his stance by stating, “We live in a generation where a responsible family man doesn’t want the mother of his children, who is also his wife, to dress provocatively just to please others.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Keke’s supporters swiftly came to her defense, ridiculing Darius, primarily known as her partner, who is a fitness trainer. “Darius Daulton just tried to humiliate Keke online so he’s not a protector,”&nbsp;<a class=link href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>one user tweeted</a>. “She makes more than him so he’s not a provider. And he had a child out of wedlock. She’s not his wife. The audacity of trying to scold her about traditional values when he meets none of the criteria.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Meanwhile, Keke’s clap backs came the same day that Darius returned to Instagram after appearing to depart social media in the wake of the drama. Though the young entrepreneur found his way back to the social media platform, his previous posts slamming Keke did not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49xZqSdm5p6sa3LppyrZaKarqTA0mabmqqZqsButsCcoqynnmLAqa3MoqWgZZ%2Bqwae102g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
