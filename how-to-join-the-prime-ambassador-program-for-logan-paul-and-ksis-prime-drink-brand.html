Showcasing one of the drink flavors, the advertisement for the program also informed that U.K. and international fans would soon get the chance to participate in the program, and receive free drinks and “monthly swag.”</p><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>To apply for the program and get the free goodies, you must set up an account on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">brand’s official website,</a> which can also be done while placing an order. Once you get that out of the way, connect to as many social media platforms as you can, and fill out the information section with your name, e-mail, and mailing address. The website will then ask a few more additional questions, and you’re all set. All that’s left is to wait for a response from the company, and hope for the best.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>So far, only U.S. applicants are being accepted into the program, but according to Prime drink, soon every fan will have a chance of getting all they have ever wished for in the energy drink realm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMraZmop%2Beu27Ax55kqaqZorJurcybmKyrkZm8s3nPq6agqpGieqe70WajqJ%2BRo3qxrdSlZJqmlGK4tLXSZqeroZ2aeqW%2ByKeiZpqilrulew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
