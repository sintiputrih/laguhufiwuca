They just couldn’t get past a few things. What they wanted going forward as a team was not the same thing, that’s really what broke them up.”</p><p>Zoe, who closely witnessed their affair, now regrets as both Lora and James had a very short life after they broke, she wishes, they could have found a way to stay together.</p><p>“As wild as she seemed on the outside, I think Lora was very grounding for James. She never stopped seeing him as the love of her life and never stopped loving him.”</p><p style=text-align:left>James, when he died unexpectedly in Rome on June 19, 2013, he had been married to former model Deborah Lin for four years.</p><p>Known for his three Emmy, Screen Actors Guild, and Golden Globe award-winning performance of Tony Soprano, the Italian-American crime boss in HBO’s The Sopranos, James was expected to travel to Sicily a few days later to receive an award at the Taormina Film Fest; when his 14-year-old son Michael discovered him unconscious on the bathroom floor at the Boscolo Exedra Hotel.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>How Old Was Lora Somoza?</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Lora Somoza was 51 when she died — the same age at which her ex.

That was just mind-boggling and really, really difficult for Lora.”</p><p>Shortly before her death, the Sun reported, she posted a photo of herself with Gandolfini and wrote: “It’s been 7 years.
