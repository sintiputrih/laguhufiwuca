It's a powerful visual, but in line with what we've come to expect from the always-original singer.</p><p>Florence and the Machine's videos are so artistically well-done and provocative that I won't attempt to break down a meaning to "Delilah." However, the imagery is definitely worth a discussion. It's a grungy setting in which to see Welch, but that's only the beginning of the video. At the start, she is sprawled out on the couch, listening to a man explain, "You think you have lost your faith, but you have not. You have only misplaced your faith and you can find it where it lays now, deep in your soul. And the way to do that is through the simple process of love. Love yourself, forgive yourself. You can't love and forgive other people if first of all you don't love and forgive yourself ..."</p><p>This sets the tone for the entire video, as Welch not only appears to undergo religious experiences, but includes plenty of symbolic nods as well. You can check out the 11 most moving GIFs from "Delilah" below.</p><p></p><h3>1. This Opening Shot</h3><p>Which sets the scene for the entire video.</p><h3>2. The Two Florences</h3><p>And one of them is reaching out to the other.</p><h3>3. This Possible Samson Reference</h3><p>Although that could be my interpretation of her cutting his hair.</p><h3>4. This Emotional Embrace</h3><p>And Welch's expression says everything.</p><h3>5. This Nod To Original Sin</h3><p>Again, it could just be me projecting.</p><h3>6. This Powerful Experience</h3><p>Which appears to be a turning point.</p><h3>7. This Goblin Interaction</h3><p>I won't wager what this symbolizes, but it looks serious.</p><h3>8. This Choreographed Moment</h3><p>One of the coolest parts in the video.</p><h3>9. This Intensity</h3><p>This took an even more serious tone.</p><h3>10. This Change In Scenery</h3><p>And suddenly we're out of the motel.</p><h3>11. This Closing Shot</h3><p>It appears that Welch broke character for this ending.</p><p>You can watch Florence and the Machine's "Delilah" video above.</p><p><i>Images: Island Def Jam (screenshot); Island Def Jam (11)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfZdtbW9llqG8s7HNnJxmrJiaeq6twqGgp52jYrGmuMilmKFlpp6xpruMsKClpF2ivLexjLKmrmWRqHqmwsidnKeblZl6o8WMrZ%2Beq5VifnJ5xqKdrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
