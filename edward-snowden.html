Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped."</i></p><h3>How much did Snowden disclose?</h3><p>After working for the CIA from 2006-2009, Snowden began working for the National Security Agency (NSA) as an employee of Dell.

Further, a U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency reports stated that Snowden took 900,000 Department of Defense files.</p><h2>Potential Impact on U.S National Security</h2><p>The Snowden documents contained highly sensitive NSA blueprints, which showed how the NSA operates. If someone would read them, then they could evade or even duplicate NSA surveillance.</p><p>In July 2015, an article published by the New York Times reported that the terror group Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL) had studied revelations from Snowden about how the United States gathered information on militants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/24/Ed1-1600955026337.jpg><p>While Snowden stated he didn't turn over documents to journalists, the redaction of a document by the New York Times resulted in the exposure of intelligence activity against Al-Qaeda.</p><p>On <i>June 14, 2015</i>, The Sunday Times reported that Russian and Chinese intelligence services had decrypted more than 1 million classified files in the Snowden cache.
