Twenty-one years after A League of Their Own was released in theaters, leading lady <strong>Geena Davis</strong> is still rocking her 1940s baseball dress from the movie. On Friday, Aug. 2, the 57-year-old actress channeled her character, Dottie Hinson, in a replica of her Rockford Peaches uniform, complete with a red cap and knee socks.</p><p>In lieu of a catcher’s mitt or baseball bat, though, Davis — 36 when A League of Their Own came out — brandished an archer’s bow and had a pack of arrows slung across her back. She appeared to be filming some kind of a commercial.</p><p>Set during World War II, A League of Their Own featured the Thelma & Louise star as a player in the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. <a href=#><strong>Tom Hanks</strong></a> played her surly manager, Jimmy Dugan, and <a href=#><strong>Madonna</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Rosie O’Donnell</strong></a>, and <strong>Ann Cusack</strong> (<strong>John</strong> and <strong>Joan Cusack</strong>‘s sister) played her teammates. (The movie also starred <strong>Jon Lovitz</strong>, <strong>Bill Pullman</strong>, and <strong>Tea Leoni</strong>.)</p><p>Speaking about the filmmaking experience in an interview with <a href=#>Parade</a> last year, the comedy-drama’s 20th anniversary, Davis said she was surprised at how beloved the movie was — and still is. “I certainly hoped people would like it and that it would be successful, but the success we had at the box office was a really big deal back then,” she said. “Even today, lots of 15-year-old girls will tell me, ‘I play sports because of that movie.’ It’s fantastic.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>In fact, A League of Their Own was Davis’ initiation into sports, too. “I was supposed to play the best baseball player anyone has ever seen, but I didn’t know how to play baseball at all — or any other sport, really!” she told Parade. “I had to learn how to look like I was that player.”</p><p>“They had tremendous major league coaches who were really great, and I remember one of the coaches even saying, ‘Hey! You’re picking this up pretty fast. Looks like you had some untapped athletic ability!'” she explained. “It was a challenge, but I got to where I was pretty good. I sort of pretended I was Jackie Cooper on the ball field.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagnZWjrm6wwK%2BgrGWipLCsv4yaZKWdkZzCpnnOn2StoJWev2671qdkrqaZm7yzuYyaq2aZl5p6doOMa2dqa2ZtfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
