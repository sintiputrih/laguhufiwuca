times in the chest, as captured by a CCTV camera at the scene.</p><p>Emergency services rushed him to a nearby hospital, but the injuries proved fatal, leading to his untimely passing. Law enforcement officials are actively investigating to apprehend the assailant.</p><p>Carson, a passionate advocate for social justice, had a mission to improve the state of New York.

Suddenly, the man turned their way and commented on launching an attack.</p><p>Carson bravely stepped between his girlfriend and the agitated stranger, attempting to defuse the situation. However, the aggressor continued to advance on the couple, ultimately drawing a knife.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Activist Ryan Carson murder suspect wanted" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Activist-Ryan-Carson-murder-suspect-wanted.webp alt="Activist Ryan Carson murder suspect wanted" width=400 height=468 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The video reveals the assailant grabbing Carson’s jacket and violently knocking him to the ground, repeatedly stabbing him in the chest as the girlfriend desperately caught up to the horrific scene.</p><p>Afterward, the assailant callously walked away, leaving Carson curled on the ground. He later returned and approached the frightened woman, who bravely raised her hand to deter him.</p><p>Disregarding her, the assailant spat on her while clutching the knife, kicking Carson’s fatally wounded body before escaping. Carson was promptly taken to Kings County Hospital, but tragically, the injuries inflicted by the knife proved fatal, as they had pierced his heart.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Journalist Josh Kruger Wiki, Obituary, Age, Wife, Girlfriend, Parents and More</a></p><p><img decoding=async title="Activist Ryan Carson&nbsp;Biography" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Activist-Ryan-Carson-Biography.webp alt="Activist Ryan Carson&nbsp;Biography" width=400 height=510 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Activist Ryan Carson Family Background</strong></h2><p>In 1991, Ryan Carson (age 32)was born to his parents in Massachusetts, United States.
