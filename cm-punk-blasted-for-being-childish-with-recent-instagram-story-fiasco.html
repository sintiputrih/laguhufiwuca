Punk recently went after Chris Jericho and others on Instagram, and now it seems he was blasted for the same.</p><p>After the AEW All Out event, CM Punk made some scathing remarks during a media scrum where he criticized fellow wrestlers Colt Cabana, Hangman Page, and The Young Bucks. The ramifications of the brawl that ensued afterwards are still being felt in AEW.</p><p>CM Punk caused another storm after&nbsp;<a href=#>he went on scathing rant in his now-deleted Instagram story</a>. In his story, the Second City Saint targeted Jon Moxley, Dave Meltzer and Chris Jericho.</p><p>CM Punk claimed that Jon Moxley did not want to put over Punk during their feud. Punk also called Chris Jericho a liar and a stooge. In fact,&nbsp;<a href=#>Punk and Moxley had legitimate heat in AEW</a>.</p><p>While speaking on his <a href=#>Hall of Fame podcast</a>, Booker T addressed CM Punk’s most recent controversy. The WWE Hall of Famer criticized CM Punk for being childish and then gave props to Chris Jericho.</p><p>“One thing about insider information and stuff like that, brother, it just goes to show me what this business is. Where you’re talking about the business, and giving all of the insider information to the fans that watch. They’re the ones that’re writing your check. That’s the dumbest thing I could ever imagine in my life! Certain terms being used in that little soliloquy… It just amazes me how childish these guys really are.”&nbsp;</p><p>According to Booker T, Punk referred to Chris Jericho as a “stooge” but Booker believes that Jericho has been nothing but professional throughout his time in the company. Booker expressed confusion over Punk’s negative comments about Jericho and couldn’t understand why he would speak so harshly about his WrestleMania 28 opponent.</p><p>Furthermore, Booker T was also taken aback by CM Punk’s comments about Jon Moxley refusing to lose to him. The former wrestler called it “the [most] childish thing I’ve ever seen in my life, as far as a 44-year-old man talking on [Instagram].”</p><p>Chris Jericho also hit back at&nbsp;<a href=#>CM Punk for calling him liar and a stooge</a>. Regardless, we will have to wait and see whether The Second City Saint will ever make his comeback to AEW.</p><p>Are you a CM Punk fan? Do you want to see him back in AEW?
