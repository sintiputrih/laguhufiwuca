His expertise in these areas made him a sought-after collaborator and mentor, and his impact extended beyond the academic realm.&nbsp;In addition to his scholarly pursuits, Dr. Desai’s leadership qualities were evident in the countless lives he touched through his mentorship and guidance. Colleagues and students remember him not only for his intellectual brilliance but also for his kindness, humility, and genuine concern for the well-being of those around him.</p><p>The Structural Health and Psychology lab, a testament to Dr. Desai’s innovative spirit, was a hub for cutting-edge research that aimed to bridge the gap between mental health and broader structural influences.
