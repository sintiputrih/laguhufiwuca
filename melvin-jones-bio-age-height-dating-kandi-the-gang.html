It featured coworkers clashing, Burruss’ family members fighting with the waitstaff, and there were even a few hookups caught on camera.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even Melvin was having a hard time after Todd had some concerns about the kitchen. Being dealt a difficult hand at the restaurant, Melvin was struggling to keep his job. A few even believed that he would have to say goodbye to the restaurant for the greater good of OLG.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Melvinthis season were his co-stars — Patrick Dallas, Shawndreca Robinson, Dom’Unique Variety, Brian Redmond, Torin Mitchell, Brandon Black, Phillip Frempong, and Rashard Roles.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to the show’s lead Kandi, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Kandi & the Gang</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> celebrates the intersectionality of its black and queer stars.
