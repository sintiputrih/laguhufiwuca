Her 9-year-old is visibly distraught over the situation in the clip, but what troubled viewers the most was the very end of the video, where Jordan tells the child, "act like you're crying" as she holds him and poses for a thumbnail to use in the video.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>this is so DISTURBING what is wrong with mom vloggers omfg <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/krUjM5Sfit</a></p>‚Äî elle woods ‚ôøÔ∏é 24 (@artangeIII) <a href=#>September 8, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>everyone keeps asking the same questions</p><p>‚Ä¢ this is about the puppy they just bought having parvo<br>‚Ä¢ the son IS crying. real tears. shes forcing him to ‚Äúfake cry‚Äù for views<br>‚Ä¢ it was accidentally uploaded, she forgot to edit this part<br>‚Ä¢ she removed the vid & posted an ‚Äòapology‚Äô</p>‚Äî elle woods ‚ôøÔ∏é 24 (@artangeIII) <a href=#>September 9, 2021</a></figure><p>The boy responds with tears in his eyes saying, "I am crying."
