While it can be argued that almost all forms of entertainment does this to some capacity, the difference between a tasteful show of someone struggling to persevere in an emotionally difficult situation and another just trying to tug on heartstrings to <a href=#>"display" their emotions is palpable</a>.</p><p>There's no shortage of social media stars and personalities who do the latter, and when it comes to a massive platform like YouTube, there are thousands of influencers who will utilize tried and true thumbnail images designed to get as many clicks as possible so they can hoodwink folks into effectively "buying" content that presents itself as a raw display of human emotions.</p><p>However, as it isn't hard to imagine, there's a large number of influencers who know exactly what they're doing and won't hesitate to forego humanity and common decency in a bid to get people to click on their clips.</p><p>Which is something that Vlogger Jordan Cheyenne has found herself wrestling with in the wake of a recent scandal that involved her crying son and the illness of their family puppy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Jordan accidentally uploaded an unedited video of her and her son crying over their poor pup's medical condition. Her 9-year-old is visibly distraught over the situation in the clip, but what troubled viewers the most was the very end of the video, where Jordan tells the child, "act like you're crying" as she holds him and poses for a thumbnail to use in the video.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>this is so DISTURBING what is wrong with mom vloggers omfg <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/krUjM5Sfit</a></p>— elle woods ♿︎ 24 (@artangeIII) <a href=#>September 8, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>everyone keeps asking the same questions</p><p>• this is about the puppy they just bought having parvo<br>• the son IS crying. real tears. shes forcing him to “fake cry” for views<br>• it was accidentally uploaded, she forgot to edit this part<br>• she removed the vid & posted an ‘apology’</p>— elle woods ♿︎ 24 (@artangeIII) <a href=#>September 9, 2021</a></figure><p>The boy responds with tears in his eyes saying, "I am crying." The emotionally manipulative video has been called out by denizens of the web as "disturbing" and "disgusting" and it didn't take long for Jordan to go viral for all the wrong reasons.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>everyone keeps asking why i liked the video</p><p>I saw her apology first & immediately searched for the footage to see if anyone caught it before it was deleted</p><p>i screen recorded THEIR screen recording. THEY liked it not me. click the link above & youll see its not my video lol</p>— elle woods ♿︎ 24 (@artangeIII) <a href=#>September 11, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I will NEVER understand showing your child breaking down on the internet. You’re supposed to protect them. These kids that come from families who vlog everything, get bullied at school all the time. Family channels shouldn’t exist. Most of them have done this at some point</p>— bri✨21 and bi (@itsmebri777) <a href=#>September 9, 2021</a></figure><p>After coming under fire from those who watched the video, Jordan went online to talk to her over 500,000 subscribers in a vlog post. In the clip she says, "it was so disgusting of me, I should not have done that at all. I re-watched it and you guys are completely right."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Her apology is just.. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/a16v07e3gb</a></p>— RIP Neji🥺 (@aprettyPR) <a href=#>September 10, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wow... I feel so sad for that little boy. Instead of being able to feel his feelings he has to put on a show for his mom’s insta. Men already have trouble expressing emotions. He’s going to need therapy in the future. I’m sure this isn’t the only time she’s done this to him. 😢</p>— katrina.blust (@BlustKatrina) <a href=#>September 12, 2021</a></figure><p>She followed up by stating that she would be "fully taking a step back from social media" and that moving forward she would not include her son in any more of her content.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Idk how these women can cry on cue like that...that's the most disturbing part. 😐 I've lost a family member so I actually cry; but these women have had nothing happen to them and then cry one cue, and then when their child is in pain...they don't even console them.👀.... wtf?!</p>— Uovodolce (@uovodolce) <a href=#>September 14, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You have done a great service, no need to defend or explain yourself! The concept of ‘content producers’ has really gotten out of hand, and this is a great example of why.</p>— Glenn Knarr (@gfk328) <a href=#>September 11, 2021</a></figure><p>Then, on September 12, folks who tried to visit Cheyenne's page noticed it was inaccessible with messages stating: "this channel does not exist" and/or "this page isn't available."</p><p>It appears that as of this writing, Cheyenne has deleted her YouTube page. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Blade</a> Cheyenne had amassed from 536,000 subscribers to her channel prior to her decision to delete it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Well hopefully the folks who "follow" these kinds of (ahem, cough-cough) "influencers", realize most of those folks they "follow" do very similar things.

She's got to be his rock & this isn't it. Don't do shit like this to a kid for views.
