The first season was a breakout hit for Hulu, and the undeniable though unexpected chemistry of the three leads – at least vis-a-vis the septuagenarian Short and Martin with the 29-year-old former Disney star, Gomez – has led to an abundance of critical praise, multiple award nods, and a dedicated fanbase.</p><p data-characters=582 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>Created by Martin and John Hoffman, Only Murders in the Building, or OMITB as it’s known colloquially, spent season ones following the three leads as they use their supposed true crime knowledge to solve a murder. And, to be fair, start their own hit podcast about said murder. As they get closer to finding a suspect, they are surprised to find out deeper secrets about themselves as well as the other occupants of their complex. When they discover the killer may still be living among them, it becomes a race to find out just who the murderer is before it’s too late.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=742 data-injectable=true>Rapaport will be familiar to TV audiences from his lead roles on Boston Public, The War at Home, Prison Break, and Atypical, as well as his numerous recurring parts on series such as Friends, My Name Is Earl, and Justified.
