Sometimes it’s also about hurricanes and rainfall, which symbolizes sadness and grief. Young Dolph and his family were having the best days of their lives and were living a great life together.</p><p>Sadly, their happiness was cut short. On November 17, 2021, Aria and Tre’s dad, Young Dolph, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">took his last breath</a>. At the age of 36, he died after he was fatally shot. The incident took place outside a local business named Makeda’s Butter Cookies on Airways Blvd.</p><p>According to the business owner, <strong>Maurice Hill,</strong> the late rapper had entered his place of business to buy cookies. At that time, a vehicle approached, and someone fired the fatal shot. Memphis police officers responded to the scene of the shooting at 2370 Airways, where they located one male victim who had already died at the scene.</p><p>Later, the victim was identified as the rapper. The Memphis Police Department updated about the incident through their Twitter page.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Chief CJ Davis is on the scene of the shooting in the 2300 block of Airways. Please see the update below. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/88vikuTOpP</a></p><p>— Memphis Police Dept (@MEM_PoliceDept) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">November 17, 2021</a></p><p>Losing their loving dad at such a young age must have been challenging and hard for young Tre and Aria. However, Young Dolph’s children are now in the care of their mother, Mia, who must be providing them with immense love and care.</p><p>Young Dolph was a great rapper and a doting dad to his children, whom he prioritized over everything. And while we will never get to see Young Dolph and his kids together, let’s hope Aria and Tre will come forward to honor Young Dolph’s legacy in the coming days.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Name_Meaning></span>Name Meaning<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The name Tre has a French origin, and it means Three.</p><p>The name Aria has an Italian origin, and it means&nbsp;Solo Melody.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq7JlkpavqrHSaLCorZ6ceqW7y6mfZpuYnrmlvsSnZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
