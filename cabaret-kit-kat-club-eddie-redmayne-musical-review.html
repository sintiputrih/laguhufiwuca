And special it is.</p><p id=eKW-2frFBciW data-wc=1><strong>SEE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>20 best things to do in festive London in December</a></strong></p><p id=eQhvdCBhRqoi data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Best festive menus in London: The ultimate guide to Christmas dinner in the city</a></strong></p><p id=edm-uCXQv0NM data-wc=56>While there is nothing neat in the Playhouse Theatre's version of the 1966 musical, that is quite the whole point. Wigs are abandoned and lipstick is smeared as characters freefall through emotions. Costumes are swapped at a dizzying pace.<strong> The cast are as bawdy and messy as Berlin itself, making the perfected choreography even more impressive.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/63d3de43582f-cliff-bradshaw-z.jpg><p id=esMFfOOFRUxp data-wc=94>Eddie Redmayne wastes no time in proving why he is one of the best actors of his generation as the entrancing enigma that is Emcee. <strong>He goes from clownish to sinister at every given turn, with his body and face contorting as he descends from humorous frivolity to seething hatred</strong>, taking the raucous chorus – an immensely talented group who appear to be having the time of their lives – along for the ride with him. We also have to give a special shout out to Liza Sadovy, who is wonderful as&nbsp;Fraulein Schneider.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/57fd1a5c1ab4-cabaret-chorus-z.jpg><p id=e-ExDZTa3riM data-wc=55>To keep some things a secret, and indeed, the Playhouse Theatre is rather invested in their guests seeing the wonder for themselves – even giving out stickers to cover phone lenses - <strong>some of Eddie's costumes along with the clever staging simply must be seen to be believed. And we promise you won't look away. &nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e8ilsjtYzayH data-wc=67>Meanwhile, Jessie Buckley is not to be underestimated as the vaguely untalented Sally Bowles, who is presented as such by Jessie's own teeming genius as a singer and actress. <strong>Her Sally varies from basking in&nbsp;frivolity to revealing her true, heartbreaking vulnerability,</strong> to eventually returning to painful levity as the&nbsp;determination to live her life as if in a dream wins out, leaving exactly no one happy.</p><p id=ekA-06Klh9FA data-wc=13>Except the audience who are on their feet in rapturous applause, of course.</p><p id=enh2NVuggtei data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2tpYWd%2BdH2RcW9vaV%2BYrqOt0Z6rZqOZqXqsrdNmmqWtkmKypbDInmSrnZSirrq6xGakrquZmK6tedGeraKdp2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
