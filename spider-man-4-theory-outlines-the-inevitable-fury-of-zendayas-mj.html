Recommended Videos Well, that’s what Reddit user herequeerandgreat posited in a recent post. They mentioned the final scene of No Way Home, where we see that Peter Parker (Tom Holland) has been wiped from the memories of everyone he loves."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They mentioned the final scene of No Way Home, where we see that Peter Parker (Tom Holland) has been wiped from the memories of everyone he loves. He approaches MJ (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zendaya</a>) with plans to (re)introduce himself, but he decides against it and walks away.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true><a href=#>[MCU]if mary jane regains her memories of peter, she is going to be livid with him.</a><br>by<a href=#>u/herequeerandgreat</a> in<a href=#>FanTheories</a></figure><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>Peter and MJ are likely going to reunite in Spider-Man 4, and when they do, MJ is going to be pretty ticked off that Peter walked away. Right before her memory was wiped, MJ made him promise that he would come and find her, so when she finds out that he didn’t, there will definitely be some demands for an excuse. “Needless to say, Peter is going to have to work very hard to regain Mary Jane’s trust,” the user adds.</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>It’s an excellent point, and one that the writers of Spider-Man 4 are going to have to navigate carefully. The impact of the No Way Home ending came from its ambiguity. The viewer wasn’t told whether Peter removed himself from MJ’s life forever, or if he simply wasn’t ready to introduce himself, and planned to do so at a later date. There was room for interpretation, which is something that’s exceedingly rare in the episodic MCU.</p><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Providing a concrete answer could be risky. It could lessen the emotional impact of No Way Home, which was considered to be one of the best MCU releases in Phase 4, and it would run the risk of being compared to the Star Lord (Chris Pratt) and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) plot in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3. The Gamora we saw in that film was from a different timeline, and she therefore had no memory of her romance with Star Lord. The characters then bond, and reconnect over the course of their adventure. Sounds similar, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tom-holland-spider-man.jpg><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>While not official, insiders have claimed that Holland, Zendaya, and director Jon Watts will all be returning for Spider-Man 4. Holland talked about the film at the premiere of his miniseries The Crowded Room, and though he was optimistic, he made it clear that things were still being sorted out. He also revealed that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">talks have been halted</a> due to the ongoing writers strike.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>“I can’t talk about that, but I can say that we have been having meetings,” <a href=#>Holland explained</a>. “We’ve put the meetings on pause in solidarity with the writers. There’s been multiple conversations had, but at this point it’s very, very early stages.”</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=false>Amy Pascal, who produced the MCU/Sony trilogy, echoed support for the writers strike. She did, however, make it clear that fans would be getting another film regardless of how long it takes to get made. “Are we going to make another movie? Of course we are,” she asserted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqmhlJq%2FbrnAp2RtZaSdsrC%2B2Gamrqycnrumv4ytn55lmaOyt7XTmpmlnV2bwrPFjKidZrKVo7GixcCsZKaiXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
