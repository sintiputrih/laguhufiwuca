The couple quickly became a fan favorite, with their immediate chemistry and attraction upon meeting. On decision day, the two decided to remain married, making audiences around America cheer. Unfortunately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amelia and Bennet quietly divorced</a> a year later.

Since the split last October, Amelia has gone on to meet a new beau. She is now in a relationship with Alexander Bayer, an avid adventurer and Yoga Coach. It hasn’t been determined when they started dating, but Amelia posted a photo of him and herself in January of this year.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Married At First Sight Couples Break Up Amid Rumors The Show Is Utterly Fake</a></span></p><h2 id=brett-lindsey-mostly-posts-about-cats-amp-restaurants><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Brett Lindsey Mostly Posts About Cats & Restaurants</span></h2><p>Brett Lindsey and Olivia Cornu were seemingly doomed from the start.

At the end of the show, they both decided to get a divorce, and Brett has dedicated his life to finding delicious restaurants and loving on cats. He posted photos with a supposed girlfriend on Instagram last year, but he seems to be single again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-cornu-is-finding-ways-to-enjoy-her-singleness><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Olivia Cornu Is Finding Ways To Enjoy Her Singleness</span></h2><p>Olivia Cornu’s downfall in her marriage was her inability to compromise with Brett and their constant disagreements.

She is a nurse practitioner, dog and cat mom, runner, and just recently started a true-crime podcast called Check the Locks with her friend John Conner.</p><h2 id=christina-croce-keeps-her-life-on-the-down-low><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Christina Croce Keeps Her Life On The Down-Low</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On decision day, Henry Rodriguez and Christina Croce chose to end their marriage.

Christina has since kept her life on the DL, keeping any of her social media profiles on private and her personal life, well, personal.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To The 'Married At First Sight' Season 14 Couples?</a></span></p><h2 id=henry-rodriguez-has-found-a-new-lady><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Henry Rodriguez Has Found A New Lady</span></h2><p>Henry Rodriguez has moved on from his divorce and is currently dating a woman named Kayla McCormick.
