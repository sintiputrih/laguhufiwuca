This 2012 book reveals how Plagueis and Sidious’ relationship worked, as well as a rundown of his political machinations and how he trained Darth Maul. Palpatine is such a fantastic villain that we take grim satisfaction in watching him win, so seeing him outwit stuffy Galactic Senators with his Dark Side trickery would be a fun ride.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>The only fly in the ointment would be finding someone to play young Palpatine.
