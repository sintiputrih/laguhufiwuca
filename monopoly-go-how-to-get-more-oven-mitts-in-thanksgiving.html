And we are as disappointed as a lot of you at that because we didn't get to complete the event. However that's more o do with a normally reliable partner not really contributing much this time around.</b></p><p>On our <a href=#>Free Mitts Links</a> page you can find out why we think there are no mitts links yet and when we think we'll get them.</p><h3>Quick Wins</h3><p>Quik Wins refresh daily, so throughout the duration of <a href=#>Thanksgiving Partners</a> there will be opportunities to get more oven mitts by completing Quick Wins. Quick Wins are great at the moment, there is also a five-star purple sticker pack to be won and the big reward of a 5-star golden purple sticker pack for completing a week's worth of Quick Wins.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/resource.appgamer.com/library/appgamer/320w/2023/quick-wins-mitts-rewards.webp alt sizes="(max-width: 420px) 320px, (max-width: 600px) 480px, (max-width: 700px) 640px" title style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Board Collection</h3><p>There are loads of oven mitts scattered around the board, you can't miss them - they are massive, land on any of these and you'll get the number of mitts which is the size of your multiplier. So it's not the best way to target mitts, but it's a decent consolation prize if you just missed an event or tournament tile you may have been aiming for.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/resource.appgamer.com/library/appgamer/320w/2023/oven-mitts-monopoly-go.webp alt="Find some Oven Mitts on the Board" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 320px, (max-width: 600px) 480px, (max-width: 700px) 640px" title="Find some Oven Mitts on the Board" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Find some Oven Mitts on the Board</p><h3>Main Events</h3><p>Main events are probably the biggest and best source of oven mitts, they are easy enough to get as you work your way through the initial milestones, but getting through the later milestones is always tough, so those mitts may be a step too far for a lot of players. Take a look at the current main event's rewards list to see what's available and where - <a href=#>Epic Myths Rewards and Milestones</a>. In total there are thousands available to be won in this main event alone.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/resource.appgamer.com/library/appgamer/320w/2023/epic-myths-mitts.webp alt sizes="(max-width: 420px) 320px, (max-width: 600px) 480px, (max-width: 700px) 640px" title style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Tournaments</h3><p>Tournaments will also give out oven mitts. The current tournament is <a href=#>Olympian Odyssey</a> on that page you can see the milestone list which shows you all of the mitts that you can get in this tournament and also the leaderboard rewards which give you free mitts and where you need to place at the end of the tournament to get some.</p><p>Look out for another tournament starting later today when the current one finishes.</p><h3>Shop Rewards</h3><p>Every eight hours check the shop rewards by going to the three lines at the top of the main game screen, selecting shop, then scrolling the top panel to the right until you get to the end. Sometimes as part of the reward package there are oven mitts.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/resource.appgamer.com/library/appgamer/320w/2023/shop-rewards-mitts-gift.webp alt sizes="(max-width: 420px) 320px, (max-width: 600px) 480px, (max-width: 700px) 640px" title style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Partner Wheel Spin</h3><p>One final way to get oven mitts is for a partner to land on the partner part of the wheel at that point you'll be bale to collect some mitts for their efforts. The number of mitts equates to the number of mitts they used on that spin.</p><p>With 320,000 points to complete all four pies, you'll need a ton of mitts if you want to complete <a href=#>Thanksgiving Partners</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orzPoJimnaJjsLC5jqamp6egpLm6ecaoZKGnp2LBsHnGnqtmpZ%2Bnsm671Z6lZqWZqcG0ecinZK2gkaO4tLPIr6Cnnw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
