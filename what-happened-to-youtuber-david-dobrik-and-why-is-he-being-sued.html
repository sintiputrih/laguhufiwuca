Recommended Videos The 25 year-old YouTuber is being sued by his former Vlog Squad Member, Jeff Wittek, over life-threatening injuries sustained from a prank gone wrong in 2020.
Dobrik, whose YouTube content has noticeably dropped since 2020, has been even more quiet on the platform in recent months. Given these new developments, it’s understandable why."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The stunt was part of Dobrik’s “comeback” video after a brief hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, things got out of hand, Dobrik went too far, and Wittek ended up crashing face-first into the hunk of metal.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jeff Wittek (@jeff)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>Wittek released a five-part docu-series on YouTube called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Don’t Try This At Home</a> in which he described the incident.

In 2020, a woman came forward with rape allegations against a former member of Dobrik’s Vlog Squad, Dom Zeglaitis. The incident led to severed ties with YouTube and Dobrik, as well as a hiatus that spanned all throughout 2020 and into 2021. The content creator seemed to be making a return until a few months ago when the videos stopped rolling in again. One can only assume it has to do with Wittek’s $10 million legal suit.</p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>In the same 20220 VIEWS video podcast, Dobrik called the near-fatal incident with Wittek the “biggest regret of my life.”</p><p>At the end of the day, I was the one f–king driving it. It was my video. He got hurt because I was driving. That’s it and I f–king know that and like I said, any chance I would get, I would take that back…That’ll be the biggest regret of my life. My entire life. I really hope there’s not a moment that I regret as much as that one.</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=82 data-injectable=false>We Got This Covered will update you with more information as it becomes available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZrCgkal6qa3PqZynnZRiwbB52Kisra2Smr9usMCvoJ1llKSvs7XKZpinnF2stbp5yKxkoZ1dl7KqusZmqq6dlGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
