The producer, 37, did an official annotation of various lyrics <a href=#>for music website Genius</a>, and added some scoop about Queen Bey to his take.</p><p class=p1>The-Dream took a look at the 2011 single "End of Time," a cut off of Beyonce's fourth studio album 4. Reflecting on the studio sessions he wrote, "We did a whole Fela album that didn’t go up. It was right before we did 4. We did a whole different sounding thing, about 20 songs."&nbsp;</p><p class=p2>"She said she wanted to do something that sounds like Fela," The-Dream continued, referencing musician <strong>Fela Kuti </strong>and the Broadway musical that he inspired. "That’s why there's so much of that sound in the 'End of Time.'"</p><p class=p1>The "Throw It in the Bag" performer went on to add that the lost Fela album is hardly the only Beyonce recording to stay in the archives.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>"There's always multiple albums being made," he explained. "Most of the time we're just being creative, period. We're talking about B, somebody who sings all day long and somebody who writes all day long. There's probably a hundred records just sitting around."</p><p>The-Dream, who served as a producer for Beyonce's celebrated self-titled 2013 album, gave no hint as to whether the unheard tracks will ever make it to fans. While there has been no official word as to Bey's next album, rumors have been swirling that a <a href=#>joint record</a> with her husband <strong><a href=#>Jay Z</a></strong> may be in the works.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmesZ%2BjsKZ5x5qqZmlgZXq2utGeo56Zo5qxbr%2FOp56sZaOWxrR506GcZpyimq6uecOeq5qhnKh6c3yQbmlua18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
